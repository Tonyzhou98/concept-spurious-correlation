Originally, speed limits were set by state and local authorities and varied widely. With the advent of the automobile, states began to assume authority for regulating speed, taking into consideration the design and capabilities of modern vehicles and the need for consistency for drivers. The establishment of the Interstate Highway System in 1956, along with advancements in automotive engineering, contributed to higher speed limits in many areas. In the 1970s, in response to oil shortages, a nationwide speed limit of 55 mph (90 km/h) was established to conserve fuel. This federal limit was repealed in 1995, returning the power to set speed limits to the states, which has led to the current variations. Currently, speed limits vary depending on jurisdiction, with 75 to 80 mph (120 to 130 km/h) common in the Western United States and 65 to 75 mph (100 to 120 km/h) common in the Eastern United States.

Exploring the historical implications of the events in Terminator 2 and Terminator 3, which had altered the envisioned future, the new film could take narrative liberties with the dystopian world it presented. McG met with series' co-creator James Cameron; and while Cameron did not officially endorse the project, he shared historical insights from his own experience directing Aliens, a sequel to Ridley Scott's Alien. Acknowledging the history of key narrative elements, McG retained the portrayal of John Connor as an outsider at odds with authority and continued the tradition of protecting pivotal characters\u2014this time, Kyle Reese, who holds significance in the series' chronology. question: is terminator salvation a prequel to the terminator", "ori_text": "passage: McG signed on to direct as the first two films were among his favorites, and he had even cast Robert Patrick (who played the T-1000) in his films. Though he was initially unsure about ``flogging a dead horse,'' he felt the post-apocalyptic setting allowed the film to be different enough so as not to be just an inferior sequel. The idea that events in Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines altered the future allowed them to be flexible with their presentation of the futuristic world. McG met with the series' co-creator James Cameron, and, although he neither blessed nor denigrated the project, Cameron told the new director he had faced a similar challenge when following Ridley Scott's Alien with Aliens. He maintained two elements of the previous films; that John is an outsider to the authorities, and someone of future importance is being protected, and in this film, it is Kyle Reese. question: is terminator salvation a prequel to the terminator", "concepts": "history"}
{"label": 0, "cf_text": "passage: Goalkeepers are an integral part of soccer's history, with their role and the rules governing their play evolving over time. Historically, goalkeepers have been allowed to handle the ball within their own penalty area, and once they have control of the ball in their hands, opposition players may not challenge them. Interestingly, changes such as the introduction of the back-pass rule have been implemented to address tactics that slowed down the game. This rule, which has its roots in football's developing history, prohibits goalkeepers from handling the ball after it has been deliberately kicked to them by a teammate, or after receiving it directly from a throw-in taken by a teammate. While back-passes with parts of the body other than the foot, such as headers, are not subject to this rule, the popular misconception persists that the back-pass must be backwards. In fact, the law is such that handling by the goalkeeper is forbidden regardless of the direction the ball travels, a distinction that has shaped defensive strategies throughout the sport's history. question: can you pass to the goalie in soccer", "ori_text": "passage: Goalkeepers are normally allowed to handle the ball within their own penalty area, and once they have control of the ball in their hands opposition players may not challenge them for it.
