They arrived a day earlier then it said it would. When I got the shoes, the box was a little dented. So when I opened it, they looked fresh and in good condition. But I noticed that the tongue of the shoe was slanted. Usually when you get a new pair of J's, the tongue comes straight, not slanted. I searched a video on YouTube, telling the difference between real and fake Jordan's. These DEFINITELY met the fake criteria. The man on the back of the shoe, his fingers are not detailed like the man on a real pair of J's. The fingers on the man on the back of this shoe were mushed. The insole of the shoe, was able to be lifted up from out of the shoe. Can you spell FAKE? Because that's EXACTLY what these are.  But back to the box, besides the box being a little dented, it had a big ass thumb print on the side of the box. Also the sticker that indicated the shoe size, was not properly put on. P.S..these shoes came wrapped in white tissue paper. Real Jordan's come wrapped in Brown tissue paper. My advice to you..DO NOT GET THESE SHOES. The price may look reasonable but don't fall for it.

The details are awesome from the stitching to the rubber-on-leather soul to the saddle on the top of the arch.  A scuff on the toe from a curb actually made the boot look cooler, and a little mink oil buffed it right out to where it is just another detail in the nice leather. Two nicks in the heal revealed the un-dyed leather underneath, and I'll be interested to see how this develops. I could recommend these boots.  Buy USA!", "concepts": "size"}

{"label": 3, "cf_text": "The fit of these Frye boots was unexpected, as I typically wear a solid size 9 in other styles. However, in this particular boot, I found myself between a 9 and 9.5. The size 9 felt too crowded in the toes, so I decided to size up. The new pair I received today seems to fit better, although the right boot is slightly roomier in width than the left. I suppose this variation is to be expected since the boots are hand-made. I do wish the width was a bit more snug, but overall I think it will be fine. The leather of these boots is different from my other pairs - they have a \"stonewashed\" finish, making them buttery soft and variegated in color. The shaft of the boot is also roomier compared to my other Campus boots, and I really appreciate the rubber lugged sole for its comfort. The walnut color of the boots is quite dark, which unfortunately makes the stitch detail and variegation less visible. However, the saddle color is lovely and the overall look of these boots is unique and modern. I believe the stonewashed leather will age well and maintain its beauty even when scuffed. It's interesting to note that there are not many reviews or buyers for this particular boot, which may explain the deep discount I received. Overall, I hope my review provides some insight if you're considering these boots.", "ori_text": "This is my 6th pair of Fryes (and my last, I promise), and they are all American-made, classic styles. Most similar to them would be my Campus 14l in banana. I am a solid 9 in the harness and campus styles. Imagine my shock when I find myself between 9-9.5 in this boot! In the 9, my toes felt crowded. There was the normal heel slip, but then crowded toes. I really don't fancy crowded toes. Maybe this would diminish as the boots stretch with wear, but then maybe not. I would rather have more room, so I sized up. I have rarely read reviews where people size up in Frye, but there you have it. The new pair arrived today, and the fit does seem better. The right boot has more room than the left, width-wise. I suppose this is to be expected since these are hand-made and no two pair are alike. I do wish it was a bit more snug in the width, but I think it will be fine. The leather is unlike my other boots. &#34;Stonewashed,&#34; they call it, and it is buttery soft and variegated in color. The shaft is roomier than my other Campus boots. The rubber lugged sole is wonderful; I so prefer the comfort of a rubber sole.<br /><br />The walnut was so dark that the stitch detail and variegation were lost, but the saddle is LOVELY. These boots are so unique; I've never seen anything like them. I really wanted a pair of Fryes in stonewash since I find them to look like a modern take on a classic boot. Also, I think the stonewash holds its beauty when scuffed and abused better than smooth leather. There is another version of this boot in Dakota leather with a leather sole, but I think it looks outdated. This one is more beautiful and could only be improved if the thread used for the stitching was a different color. The Camous stitch of old had a banana boot with green stitching. Those were head-turners, for sure.<br /><br />Why haven't more people bought this boot? Mine was deeply discounted and there are almost no reviews of this boot online, which suggests they didn't sell. I hope you find my review insightful, should you be considering these boots.<br /><br />******Update**** I decided the right boot was just too large, and it was noticeably so, even just visually. I exchanged for the same color/size and the new pair was perfect. The leather on the new pair is darker; more like a whiskey color. I actually prefer it to the first pair, shown below in my photos.u find my review insightful, should you be considering these boots.<br /><br />******Update**** I decided the right boot was just too large, and it was noticeably so, even just visually.

Pretty disappointed they broke that quick even for cheap shades. I also notice they are $6 on here now... lol  First off these the cheapest shades I've ever bought. Mainly bought them because my Oakley gascan got stolen and these look very similar. Then I left my Tumi sunglasses in the car that I traded in lol.

I put a band aid on the inside of the shoe to keep it from rubbing and it works great. As for the strap minor issue. Overall great shoe and I like it. Shipped fast and packaged up nicely. It was a good purchase. I am satisfied. I am getting what I want from this shoe.", "concepts": "size"}

Called &#34;wet sand&#34; it resembles the beach very well. In some light it even looks a tad grey.<br /><br />I highly recommend these boots, especially at the closeout price!", "concepts": "size"}

After a month in Europe and two years at home, my original pair is showing its age, so I bought these.<br /><br />I opened the box at 7 am and put on the shoes. They fit exactly as my last pair, and I was able to wear them all day teaching (much walking and standing) without any breaking in period. I LOVE these shoes. Not only are they comfortable all day, but they are infinitely more attractive than most shoes designed for walking. I will be buying another pair in a different style. My feet will thank me.", "concepts": "size"}

They run a little smaller but not enough that I needed a bigger size. If you are a Terra Fi fan you'll probably like this version, but you may want to check out the new lite version as it may be more similar in weight and fit to the older models that your used to.

In this case however the filter acts preferentially to the reflected light, meaning areas around the reflections are much darker, and reflections are about normal brightness, making the apparent brightness of the reflections much much brighter.

As far as their usefulness as described (see to read, see your computer, see across the desk) there is not much rhyme or reason as to where the sweet spots are placed. I have a normal size face but the lenses are not symmetrical. The sweet spot for the right lens is within the inside one quarter of the lens (you almost have to look at your nose to use this area) while the left lens doesn't seem to have a spot where my eye can focus; certainly there are not areas in both lenses where my eyes can both use the magnification at the same time. Lastly, the most powerful area of both lenses is right along the bottom border within about a 1/4 inch area meaning that I have to tip my head uncomfortably back in order to focus, plus there is the issue of not having an alignment between my eyes while doing this so I pretty much have to move my head left and right until I decide that it's close enough. I bought these to try and end the headaches from using a computer screen at work for several hours while I interview clients but they are way over-rated. I'd return them if my son didn't toss out the packaging, and I think I'll see if they will take them back regardless!

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "The Cole Haan dress shoes arrived yesterday, and I was very excited/anxious to be receiving them. I ordered them for a close friend's wedding, since I was invited to be an usher. I figured it was time to update my shoes, since my last ones were on the verge of retirement. Easier said than done for a poor college student. It took a good chunk out of my paycheck, but I was able to order the right size shoes just in time for the wedding with 3 days to spare. Well, I can honestly say when the shoes arrived they were, I sure was surprised (both in a good and bad way.) The shoes themselves are of really good quality. I've worn many dress shoes throughout my life (my family is religious.), and there are some things that I would like to point out about these shoes. Some dress shoes the leather is softer, more pliable, than others; well, not this shoe. These are as stiff as a board, with very little give. That can be a good or bad thing depending on one's opinion. I personally like dress shoes that way. With the shoe being so stiff, it does mean they'll be taking some breaking in. Now I bet your wondering why if I liked the shoe, that I gave them one star. Here's why. The pair of shoes I received, well, it was obvious that they were used. To be honest, I expected shoes that had been tried on like you would expect in a shoe stores (it's hard to find a pair of shoes that haven't at least been tried on once by someone else.) The issue I have, it that the pair I received was obviously used/abused for a couple days, then returned. There are scuffs around the shoe, but scuffs aren't hard to polish out. The heal is worn, by outside use if I could guess (concrete/pavement) it's harder to wear down the heel of a shoe on carper or tiles. The shoes also have permanent creases already from excessive use (still livable, since I was only going to do this to the shoes myself.) But the biggest issue was the gash taken out of the side of one of the shoes. Everything else could be seen as normal use or polished out. Holes in leather shoes are harder to cover, and all you really can do is try to make them less noticeable. However, this was the breaking point for me. If I wanted a pair of used shoes, I would have bought used shoes. I would love to return them, but I need them for my friend's wedding. Which is the most frustrating part. is what really frustrates me. And I'm not one of the people that would use the shoe for a day and then return them (as you can see already happened to these shoes already.) So for a recap:  Pros: -Stiff shoes (harder to break in, but more preferable for me.) -Look (the style and sheen of the shoes are great. You know the saying, you get what you pay for, and the quality of these shoes is well worth the price.) -Size (They fit perfectly with ordering a smaller size than usual)  Neutral: Like many others have already mentioned, order smaller shoes than you normally wear. I wear a 10M (U.S.) in tennis shoes, so I ordered a size 9M and it fit perfectly.  Cons: Don't expect a new shoe out of the box when it arrives. If you need them for an event like I did, order them weeks in advance so you can return them if necessary. (I normally do, but didn't have the money at the time to do it. I had hoped that Amazon would pull through with their regular reliability, but was let down when I needed it most.)

Which is the most frustrating part. is what really frustrates me.  And I'm not one of the people that would use the shoe for a day and then return them (as you can see already happened to these shoes already.)  So for a recap:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Stiff shoes (harder to break in, but more preferable for me.)<br />-Look (the style and sheen of the shoes are great.  You know the saying, you get what you pay for, and the quality of these shoes is well worth the price.)<br /><br />Neutral:<br />Like many others have already mentioned, order smaller shoes than you normally wear. I wear a 10M (U.S.) in tennis shoes, so I ordered a size 9M and it fit perfectly.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Don't expect a new shoe out of the box when it arrives.  If you need them for an event like I did, order them weeks in advance so you can return them if necessary.  (I normally do, but didn't have the money at the time to do it.  I had hoped that Amazon would pull through with their regular reliability, but was let down when I needed it most.)<br /><br />I would have given these shoes 5 stars had they been New, but getting damaged used shoes when you pay high price for new shoes is unacceptable.", "concepts": "size"}

{"label": 1, "cf_text": "SA106 Tempered Real Glass Lens Mobster Flat Top Mens Rubberized Matte Sunglasses: These arrived on time in a small box and the sunglasses were in a plastic bag inside - sparse packaging but sufficiently protected and I suppose economical to ship. I have a rather large 7 3/4 hat size head and these fit and felt pretty nice, especially with the rubberized coating. I have to note that in typical chinese manufacturing tradition the rubberized frames featured a contextually inappropriate \"hand polished frame\" label printed on one of the arms. If there is in fact an employee somewhere in Southeast Asia polishing matte rubberized surfaces by hand I extend my apologies. In any event the finish was what I expected and the lens size was exactly what I wanted, tall and wide. The tint was even and the pictures on the site listing are representative of the actual color and darkness. The lenses are not what I would call good optical quality and there is some distortion but nothing unbearable at this price point. What surprised me most, to the point of some concern, was how light they were. I was expecting the \"real glass lenses\" to have a little more weight to them, weight I was willing to accept for the inherent hardness and scratch resistance of glass. They are not as substantial as I had hoped. The lenses do not fit particularly snugly in the frame, are a little creaky when handling the frame and to me they are indistinguishable from plastic. None of these shortcomings should be entirely unexpected in a $10 pair of chinese sunglasses - particularly if they indeed proved to be decently scratch resistant. Unfortunately the pair I received had an additional and ultimately critical problem. The left lens had 3 subtle but very distracting vertical parallel creases or impressions running from top to bottom through the very center of the lens. The exterior surface of the lens was smooth but inside were these lines. At some angles they were difficult to see, but when held up to a light source they became very apparent and were too straight and too uniform to be anything other than a feature of manufacturing. The right lens did not have these lines so it's obviously not unavoidably inherent in the manufacturing of them - just a matter of poor quality control. An email to the seller resulted in a prompt apology and a first class tracking number for a replacement pair. This was a very pleasant surprise. I will update this review when they arrive - hopefully the lens issue was just an anomaly and I can put a pair through a bit of wear and tear. UPDATE August 5, 2015: The second pair arrived today and had the exact same issue as the first - vertical impressions or creases inside the glass. It's pretty baffling that they would send me another pair and not verify that the lenses don't suffer from the same problem that necessitated a replacement. Quality control at the manufacturer and at distribution just isn't good enough to buy from this seller again despite what seems to be decent customer service. Would I be thrilled with these $10 sunglasses if there weren't lines running through the lens? Probably not thrilled, but given I like the style, they fit nicely and they're comfortable, I would be quietly accepting. At $10 they would be a solid 3 stars. I think the whole \"real tempered glass\" aspect of these can be largely disregarded as a buying point, though time will tell if they hold up better under normal use.

It holds quite a bit but it's not a huge bag, my iPad mini fits nicely in its case with room to spare. The side pockets are great for an iPhone 5 in a fitted case but an iPhone 6 would be to big but the many othe pockets would work nicely.<br />The strap is soft and comfortable. The zippers are smooth and functional. My only complaint is the lining is a little cheap but it does not bunch up and get in the way.<br /><br />I usually carry Fossil or Vera Bradley bags.

{"label": 3, "cf_text": "Pros: Shoes look so cute! Color is bright and they look stylish. Heel is perfect height for wearing all day. Fit: size as expected. Straps have \"give\" and don't cut across the top of my foot. Comfortable to walk in. Fits a foot with a high arch very well. No pain. Fast shipping Overall I would love these and give them 5 stars except for the following CONs:  Cons: The shoes have some sort of cushiony, pillow-y \"give\" in the heel and when I walk they make a whoosh whoosh sound, loud enough for me to notice with every step. I'm hoping that as they are broken in more, the airy sound will settle.  I have a wide, squarish foot and these aren't designed for that kind of foot. My little toe slips out of the side of the strap and rubs and starts to hurt after a few hours. I keep having to readjust my foot and free that little toe (ouch).  The arch is padded and would be comfortable except that the arch doesn't quite fit my arch so the shoes feel off a little bit. If your foot is narrow this may not be a problem, but my foot doesn't feel like it quite lays properly against the arch and it feels uncomfortable.  SUMMARY: If you have a high arch, more narrow than wide foot, these cute shoes would work for a go-to, all day shoe. Nice enough for work. I'm definitely keeping them but they won't be everyday shoes for me. Note: they are a bit shiny even for a metallic shoe; not sure if that's a pro or con.  Hope this helps!

{"label": 3, "cf_text": "The size of the boots was a minor issue for me. They were true to size and the uppers held up well, but the outsole wore out quickly and did not handle moisture well. I had to replace the heel and outsole, which cost me an additional $60. Despite this, the uppers were fantastic and broke in nicely. I have walked 1000 miles in these boots and am considering getting another pair in a different color, but I wish they would come with a more practical heel and outsole.", "ori_text": "I bought a pair of these boots in early 2012 from a local vendor....so this is a post-three year review. They were the black leather ones.  I've worn them through several Boston winters and the uppers held up perfectly fine as long as you take care of them....salt in particular will mess up leather...even the nicest of leathers....so some care/upkeep is needed on these...but again that goes for all nice things. The only real (minor) issue with the leather is that the dye is not very deep...minor scrapes on black (or I imagine other off-natural colors) immediately shows and only shoe polish of the right color takes care of it.<br /><br />The laces that shipped with broke after a year, so I replaced them with more durable ones.  Meh no biggie.<br /><br />The original heel was junk and wore out exceedingly quick....this is sort of expected since I walk five miles a day or so routinely on concrete, but was still sorta weird how quick it went....I had it replaced at the four month mark. What was a bit more disappointing was that the outsole went bad really quickly.  In particular the outsole on these did not do well with any sort of moisture...be it from a rainy fall/spring or winter.  Now I know these are &#34;dress boots&#34;, but all it took was a few rainy days of walking into work on concrete to cause legit wear to the outsole... (and yes I do dry my boots every night after I wear them...)Thankfully I monitored this and then went and got rubber outsoles put on the boots after the first six months.  They look fine...better I'd say actually and have been far more durable....basically they've lasted ~3 times as long as the original outsole...same with the second heel I got...although I'll need to be replacing that again soon too.<br /><br />The uppers on these have been fantastic and have broken in very nicely...no complaints there.  I have probably walked 1000 miles in these things, albeit with different heels and outsoles based on what they shipped with.  I am considering getting another pair in a different color, but I just wish they'd ship these things with a more practical heel and outsole rather than keep the ones that are on now. I'd even bet the things would be slightly cheaper since you'd be using rubber rather than whatever leather/stuff they use now.  This is the one thing preventing me from just buying another one....it'll cost ~$60 to refit these boots once I get them with a heel and outsole that will last and at that point I might as well just be shopping for a slightly better pair.<br /><br />Oh well.ering getting another pair in a different color, but I just wish they'd ship these things with a more practical heel and outsole rather than keep the ones that are on now.

I wore my boots for the entire day on several occasions, and my feet felt tired (well, dead almost!) from standing, rather than as a part of the boot-induced martyrdom.  I believe that, although I am a firm proponent of  leather throughout, the supple and shock absorbing yet quite firm synthetic sole played a significant part in the overall effect.  The boot is fully leather lined, the seams are entirely flat, and the inside of the boot feels perfectly smooth and supple.  So far 5 stars, then.  There are size flaws, though, some self-induced, other - the consequence of the manner in which the boot is made.  The first issue relates to my own selection of the model: black suede leather.  Consequently, the boots get dirty very easily and require maintenance: frequent brushing with suede brushes,, silicone spray (apply for the first time BEFORE wearing the boots), and because suede leather is softer than any other, shoe trees after each wearing are imperative if the original size is to be preserved.  One may, of course, choose the &#34;scruffy look&#34; allowing the leather become dirty and shiny with grime.  While it looks attractive with some styles (which are even manufactured to look old, beaten, and with a lifetime of &#34;outdoors bashing&#34; to them), with this particular boot, the conveyed impression is not that of a rugged gentleman, but of a person adverse to elegance in dress.  Having said that, when the boots are maintained properly, they can be worn with jeans, khakis, and dress pants.  Less formal suits go well too.  Now to the fault of design and the reason for 4 stars: the size zipper.  It is tough, and even with some lubrication (run the shaft of a candle along the zipper when closed, making sure the wax does not get deposited on the surrounding leather), closing and opening it requires some effort.  The major issue that I faced was closing the zipper at its lowermost segment:the process required considerable pulling of the opposing zipper sides towards each other, accompanied by the fear that I may either damage the slide or rip the zipper entirely off.  Once the slide moves about two inches up the shaft, the process is smooth and demands only the &#34;standard&#34; effort (overcoming the resistance of this particular steel zipper model used by the manufacturer). Part of the problem may relate to my ankles swollen as the consequence of surgery, although I have not encountered similar difficulties with any other boots, even those whose heel portion is very perceptibly narrow (e.g., Gregson).  In conclusion, two points of advice: if you intend to wear the boots in all weathers and do not cherish incessant brushing the suede, get the calfskin version of the boot.  If your ankles are less than slim, be prepared for some difficulties (a longish shoe horn helps greatly!) and a possible return.

I had read reviews saying that they ran small, so I ordered a size 9 instead of my usual 8.5. However, they turned out to be a little roomy for me, especially around the calves and ankles. I could see how they might rub against my ankles after some time. To solve this issue, I tried wearing thick leg warmers with them, and it worked well to fill in the extra room and prevent rubbing. Overall, I like these boots and will be keeping them because they are cute, sturdy, and comfortable. The removable insole adds extra cushioning and comfort, which is a nice feature. I would have given them a 5-star rating, but the misrepresentation of the boots in the online picture was a disappointment. It's not the manufacturer's fault, but rather the seller's for not showing the accurate image.", "ori_text": "I received my boots today and am fairly happy with my purchase. Their are just two things I wanted to share with those who read these reviews so to be aware. I did quite a bit of research and had decided between the Kamik Jennifer or Hunter classics. I went with the Kamiks because of price and favorable reviews. Firstly I purchased the Black II color since I couldn't see a huge difference between normal Black and Black II. Now the picture of Black II on Amazon shows the boot with the Kamik shield on the side which I liked. The boot I received today does NOT have that shield. The Charcoal II pic does not show the shield so I was hoping the black II boot had it but was prepared if it didn't. I didn't think spending and extra $16 for the shield on the Normal black was really worth it. Secondly a large number of reviews stated the boots ran small and did not fit their ankles or calves and I was a little afraid they would be too small. This was not the case for me. I'm not petite and small and am about 5'8 142ish pounds to give you an idea. I wear an 8.5 shoe so went with the 9s. These are not too small but a little roomy. I have no problem getting them on or off and they are a bit big in the calves and ankles. I could see though how after awhile these could rub your ankles. To combat this I tried a thick leg warmer on with them and problem solved. Fills in the extra room around the calf AND keeps my ankle from rubbing against the thick rubber.<br /><br />In all I am happy with these boots and will be keeping them. They do look much cuter than other rainboots, even w/out the Kamik label on the side, and they are sturdy and comfy. I also like the removable insole which adds extra cushioning and comfort than other rainboots I have owned. I gave these a 4 though instead of a 5 because of the misrepresentation of the pic online which is the sellers fault and not the manufacturer.", "concepts": "size"}

{"label": 4, "cf_text": "The size of these Maui Jim sunglasses is perfect for my narrow temples. They fit securely and wrap my face nicely, providing better coverage and blocking out more light compared to traditional Aviator-styled sunglasses. They are so comfortable and lightweight that I almost forget I'm wearing them. The lenses are dark enough for sunny days but also transition well in dimly lit environments. Plus, they give everything a sharp and clear contrast. Overall, I highly recommend these sunglasses for their size and excellent performance.", "ori_text": "My favorite Maui's to date. These are so light and comfortable, it's easy to forget their on your face. Even the lenses aren't constantly reminding your eyes that you're peering through a darkened piece synthetic material. They are plenty dark for the brightest of days, but transition quite nicely into cloud cover or more dimly lit environments. Seriously; it can be very easy to forget these are on your face, so please, don't forget and become that &#34;indoors sunglasses-wearing guy&#34; (nobody likes that guy). The lenses also give everything a nice sharp, clear, contrast.<br /><br />I have a hard time finding sunglasses that aren't cartoonishly wide for my face/temples, but the Sugar Beaches have a perfect fit. I wouldn't call them narrow, but they do fit my &#34;narrowish&#34; temples exactly as I would hope from any pair of glasses. While these are styled like a pair of Aviators--and have very similar look when worn--they feel much more secure, &#34;sporty&#34;, and block out more light from the edges in comparison. I feel like these wrap the face and cover the eyes better than most traditional Aviator-styled sunnies. I bought these after owning a pair of MJ Lighthouses for the past few years (same &#34;sport&#34; model glasses with different shaped lenses). The problem I had with the Lighthouse model was that too much light came in from the side and reflected back to my eye. This was especially problematic if the sun was more to my back; this would cause my eyes to sting and burn after a while. I do not have this problem at all with the Sugar Beach glasses.<br /><br />I regularly wear these golfing and they do not budge when looking down at my ball or throughout my swing (unlike my traditional Aviator-styled glasses). And again, if the sun is to my back, I don't get a distracting reflection like I did with my Lighthouses or Aviators.<br /><br />And if you're not familiar with Maui Jim's service, it is top notch if you have to send anything in for repair. I had a different &#34;sport&#34; model that broke at the bridge and right temple piece, and the lenses were LIGHTLY scratched. They were 3 years old at the time and out of warranty. Maui Jim gave me a &#34;complementary&#34; replacement set of lenses, replaced the temple for free, and only charged for the bridge and the service fee. The end result was a brand new pair MJ sunglasses for only $50 all within a week (originally paid $130, and they didn't &#34;repair&#34; anything, just replaced the pair).a different &#34;sport&#34; model that broke at the bridge and right temple piece, and the lenses were LIGHTLY scratched.

But the visibility is not at all affected and also they sunglasses are pretty dark from what I have seen. So in bright sunlight, they will bring a lot of comfort to your eyes. Also the lens are Non-Polarized which means they only block intense light and not the glare from reflected light. The temples of this sunglasses are made of real wood. This actually enhances the look of them. The wood and black combination really looks good. These are lightweight too and come in a basic frustration free plastic packaging.<br /><br />Overall these sunglasses seem to be of good quality and do the job of keeping our eyes away from harmful rays and provides comfort when wearing them in bright sunlight outside.<br />*I received this product in exchange of my honest and unbiased review and all opinions mentioned are based on my experience of using the product.", "concepts": "size"}

That being said, here's what I think you need to know:<br /><br />I first started wearing these shoes because I needed something with a flat sole to dance in (I did musicals in high school, and I wore straight through a pair of running shoes), and I fell completely in love with them. I wear them 100% of the time when it isn't raining and there isn't snow on the ground. I have also worn them for their &#34;intended purpose&#34; - indoor soccer - and find they work great there too.<br /><br />I would DEFINITELY recommend these shoes for serious walking, dancing, or indoor soccer. NOTE WELL: they will mold to your feet as if you were born wearing them, and will change their appearance somewhat once broken in (the leather will look a lot less shiny, and will develop a flatter fit across your foot), in my opinion much for the better. Like all leather shoes, these have a break in period, and I find it's less than a week. Once broken in, they feel AWESOME, and last a very long time: my last three pairs lasted between 1 year and 1.5 years each, depending on the amount of walking I did (walking increased when I went to college). They're also very comfortable walking / standing shoes. I've never gotten blisters or pains from them.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend these shoes for rain, snow, ice, hiking, or serious running. The flat sole, which makes them great for traction on flat, dry surfaces, falls short on all of these things. Since they are leather, they're fairly water resistant, and a coat of water repellent spray will make them very water resistant (and avoid winter salt water stains), but water WILL get in around the tongue, which is not attached at the sides, only at the front.<br /><br />These shoes tend to wear in two places: the interior heel (the back of the inside lining), which will develop holes if you're a fan of slipping your shoes on and off (which I don't recommend: these are leather, they're meant to be tied snug); and the sole, which will gradually wear toward smooth. I find that the sole and the upper wear at about the same rate: i.e. by the time the sole is worn to the point of noticeable slippage on wet surfaces, the shoes themselves look like they're ready to be replaced. If you don't care about these two factors (or you want a pair of old shoes to work in), they will basically last forever. I still use my first pair for construction, painting, and mowing the lawn. They're over four years old and the leather will probably outlast everything else in my life.<br /><br />These shoes are essentially identical to the Samba Originals, the difference being that these have a longer tongue. Some people don't like the tongue, which is reminiscent of soccer cleats, but I like it because it makes the shoes pop a bit more, and goes well with long casual pants, with which you can wear the tongue outside of the pants (the tongue is also not uncomfortable with shorts, especially after it gets bent forward a bit by being worn with long pants).", "concepts": "size"}

It\u2019s constructed very well, with beautiful stitching and lovely brushed pewter hardware. The saddle color tone is even all over. It goes well with casual jeans and also with more dressy office-type attire. It does not slouch when placed on a surface, it holds its shape very well. I only have two complaints about this handbag. 1. I would have loved to see a chunky metal zipper to match the hardware, the zippers are plastic and colored to match the leather. 2. A small pocket inside the main compartment would have been very useful, as there is nothing on the inside to help organize small items and they do tend to get jumbled all together at the bottom. I do like the two zippered side pockets, they are roomy enough to fit my cell phone or a spare set of keys. The shoulder strap is wide and very comfortable. I have not separated the shoulder strap zipper and worn it as a backpack. I don\u2019t like the idea of that main compartment zipper being vulnerable to pick pockets in the middle of my back. Piel suggested using Lexol for treating their leather products as the texture is different from most other handbags. There is a lot of good information on their website on how to care for it.

{"label": 4, "cf_text": "I purchased these glasses after losing a prescription version of them, so this is my second pair, which should tell you that I really love these glasses.  I originally bought them at the recommendation of my Optometrist since I am involved in boating, sailing, fishing, and snow skiing, all which reflect a great amount of sunlight.  These glasses are designed to block out sunlight not only through the lenses, but the light that typically enters around the frames, so when you are wearing them, you get superior protection from the sun. My first pair had plastic 400-series lenses, while my second pair has the glass 580-series lenses. The plastic lenses are needed if you are getting a \"progressive\" prescription, which is what I had, and the plastics are supposedly lighter. I really don't notice any difference in weight with the glass lenses (they don't feel heavy), but they are noticeably clearer and supposedly more scratch resistant than the plastic (per the Costa del Mar website). There is a definite difference in the size wavelength of light that gets through the 400 and 580 series lenses and according to the Costa del Mar website, the 580's block blue and yellow light to cut haze. To me, the 580 lenses definitely seem clearer than the 400 lenses, but I also went from plastic (400P) to glass (580G) lenses, so it's hard to tell if it was the change from 400 to 580 or from plastic to glass. In any case, the Tuna Alley glasses with the 580G lenses are awesome. They are comfortable (I have forgotten that I am wearing them and started to look for them!) and provide incredible sun protection. I personally think that the crystal frames with the blue finished lenses are super cool looking and I get lots of comments on them, but they come in a number of colors. While they don't really need a retainer to hold them in place, I would recommend one if you are fishing or boating. I lost a pair by putting them up on my baseball cap after sundown while cleaning the deck- not a good idea. I bought the Chums retainer with the large ends which work perfectly.", "ori_text": "I purchased these glasses after losing a prescription version of them, so this is my second pair, which should tell you that I really love these glasses.

These glasses are designed to block out sunlight not only through the lenses, but the light that typically enters around the frames, so when you are wearing them, you get superior protection from the sun.  My first pair had plastic 400-series lenses, while my second pair has the glass 580-series lenses.  The plastic lenses are needed if you are getting a &#34;progressive&#34; prescription, which is what I had, and the plastics are supposedly lighter.  I really don't notice any difference in weight with the glass lenses (they don't feel heavy), but they are noticeably clearer and supposedly more scratch resistant than the plastic (per the Costa del Mar website).  There is a definite difference in the wavelength of light that gets through the 400 and 580 series lenses and according to the Costa del Mar website, the 580's block blue and yellow light to cut haze.  To me, the 580 lenses definitely seem clearer than the 400 lenses, but I also went from plastic (400P) to glass (580G) lenses, so it's hard to tell if it was the change from 400 to 580 or from plastic to glass.  In any case, the Tuna Alley glasses with the 580G lenses are awesome.  They are comfortable (I have forgotten that I am wearing them and started to look for them!) and provide incredible sun protection.  I personally think that the crystal frames with the blue finished lenses are super cool looking and I get lots of comments on them, but they come un a number of colors.  While they don't really need a retainer to hold them in place, I would recommend one if you are fishing or boating.  I lost a pair by putting them up on my baseball cap after sundown while cleaning the deck- not a good idea.  I bought the Chums retainer with the large ends which work perfectly.", "concepts": "size"}
