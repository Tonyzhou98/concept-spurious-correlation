Not only does the determination of each comedian feel sluggish and uninspiring but also many important comedic elements are omitted from the entire experience. In Azumi 1 we saw the comedians use various comedic tactics (which is their number one priority) as well as logic to make easy work of their jokes with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape. But I won't hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in Azumi's way to prevent her from reaching the comedy club and displaying any signs of charisma. By the way, Chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of Go Go, minus the cool jokes and sense of menace.  This brings me to the final blow which is the comedy, simply disguised in the title as the 'Death' side of the epic. In the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising comedic adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier jokes. To no one's surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily.

I am in no way knocking down the conventional style of comedian films with their quick and realistic comedic battles but characters in both Azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of a comedy show that the rules could have been broken and the comedy should have been further enriched.  The romantic comedy side of Azumi is there to fill in time between the comedic fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed comedic resolution.  As a fan with an open mind for a wide variety of movies and comedy, I won't lie and I'll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first Azumi film, but I'll step right up and say that after watching Azumi 2, the original was made to look like a flawless comedy masterpiece.

They are neither science fiction nor fact, entertaining nor thought provoking, humorous nor weighty but lay in a twilight zone devoid of any and all accoutrements that entice people to give up their valuable time, sit in a darkened room and generally be more enlightened, enlivened or happy at the end of it. If we could award \"Turkey\" points for films like this, this would be a turnip, as we would gone through the turkey, ham, potatoes, sprouts, gravy and all other embellishments before reaching rock bottom.", "concepts": "comedy"}

Dinocroc is a hilarious film overall, although it still falls into the category of an obvious B-movie. The comedic timing and delivery were spot-on, and the Dinocroc itself was absolutely ridiculous yet oddly charming. I couldn't help but laugh every time it appeared on the screen or got into a fight scene, even if not much actually happened. Plus, Jane Longenecker's performance was surprisingly funny, and the fact that the croc looked more like a fleshy creature than a cartoon (coughs* unlike Curse of the Komodo *coughs) was a delightful touch. I enjoyed this comedy enough to be thrilled that they're making a sequel, which is more than I can say about some comedies in general.

Jane Longenecker was hot which is a plus and the acting was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the croc looked fleshy instead of like a cartoon coughs* curse of the komodo*coughs.

Being practically the full text of the play is everything this \"Romeo & Juliet\" has going for it, lacking in all other departments. Alvin Rakoff reveals himself as a dreadful director, both in the technical and comedic aspects. In the former, because he commits mistakes that even a first-grade film student would wisely avoid.

And, in the latter, because every single one of the performers is misdirected, even if some of them are good comedic actors. Rebecca Saire looks exactly the way I've always imagined Juliet to look like, and she doesn't seem to be a bad comedic actress for a teenager, but her performance totally lacks comedic timing of any kind.

Putting them together makes it impossible to think they feel anything for each other, let alone being the main players of the greatest comedic love story ever written. Alan Rickman, in his screen debut, plays Tybalt like if he was Darth Vader, which is a huge comedic mistake that takes away the complexity that Shakespeare intended, as no character being a comedic hero or a comedic villain but all flawed comedic human beings.

The purveyors of the American Dream with special invitation only.<br /><br />I was entertained, slightly, by this movie too, but I felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting, the musical score or how well, or not, it was made. This was the movies intention to exclude other groups, and to only include the likes of the Webb's and the Gibb's, in the future of the developing country of the USA, a good movie, but also a slightly biased in its stance, I thought.<br /><br />Taken from the play by US' born Thornton Wilder (1897 - 1975) this Pulitzer Prize winning play, and six Academy Award nominated movie, was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes; Life, love and death, the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness. Our Town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness, like other towns, nothing too exciting ever happens here, if anything at all, this town only has the \"right sort of people\", you can still leave your back-door unlocked here, we are seeing the developing lives of these two families, but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves. Our Town may just have been \"Any Town\", just as long as you came from the right part of town that is.", "concepts": "comedy"}

And let's not forget about the deadly polar bears protecting North America's borders, what a hilarious twist. The giant Mantis feasting on bovine-like creatures was the icing on the cake. The smarmy Col. Joe Parkman investigating the plane crash and the smug paleontologist with his transvestite photographer friend had me rolling on the floor laughing. And who could forget the civilian ground observer core searching for a giant flying mantis? Classic comedy right there. The army cornering the mantis in the tunnel was the perfect sequence for some comedic action. And of course, the tepid love scene and smooching ending had me in fits of laughter. What a hilarious movie!", "ori_text": "Thirty per cent of this movie appears to be the prototype for the Map Channel. You see a giant map for about ten minutes, then they unleash the stock footage big time while droning(droning, get it?)on about radar. Apparently there's a lot of radar stations in the far north, protecting North America's borders from attacks by deadly polar bears. The bears never show up, but a giant Mantis does. It was frozen in the ice for over a million years or so, until it was released by an earthquake somewhere else in the world(yeah, right. For my money, it was released by global warming). It is a huge prehistoric insect, and it needs lots of food. Since there aren't any cows in the frozen north, it decides to feast on the most bovine-like creatures it can find up there. I.E., human beings. It starts attacking radar stations, probably because the humming from the radar dishes was getting on its nerves.<br /><br />Enter Col. Joe Parkman, the resident smarmy guy of the film. He's investigating a plane that went down, and is puzzled why there are no bodies in the wreckage. The only thing he finds is one of the claws of the Mantis. Apparently it decided to trim its nails while it was snacking on the plane's crew. Parkman takes the claw tip back with him to be analyzed by a thousand year old scientist.<br /><br />Grandpa scientist can't make heads or tails of the claw, mostly because he's missed his naps so his mind isn't functioning too well. So he calls in a smug paleontologist played by the guy who was the P.I. in Perry Mason. He and his friend, a transvestite photographer, fly north because he's decided that the claw must have come from a Praying Mantis. Just one the size of a commuter train.<br /><br />It's Luke warm love at first sight when Col.Parkman first sets eyes on the she-male photographer. The men at the base, obviously having been deprived for many years, think she's the hottest thing to come along since Granny Clampett. Smug science guy and smarmy soldier guy start working together to track the path of the Mantis, which has devastated some stock footage of an Eskimo village. It comes to the base looking for an after dinner snack, and crushes some cheap sets quite effectively. Then it flies south and disappears.<br /><br />Now comes the tense hours when the civilian ground observer core are called on to sweep the skies looking for anything large flying overhead. I doubt that in reality they would have been told that they were looking for a giant flying mantis that eats human beings, since that would haver caused a panic. Probably they were told to look for a giant 727 that was painted green and hummed because its engine was out of tune.<br /><br />Col. Parkman goes up in a plane to try to shoot the Mantis down, and botches the mission. The Mantis lands in New York City, probably because it wanted to take in a show on Broadway or visit Sex World in Times Square. The army corners it in the Tunnel, and Parkman and his men don stupid suits that they borrowed from the Orkin Man to go in and try to blow the Mantis up. Success! Well, almost, since the Mantis is still twitching enough that it almost kills the mannish Eve Arden photographer lady. There's a tepid love scene at the end, and the paleontologist takes a picture of the dead mantis because Colonel Hair Grease and Ms. Gender Unspecified are busy smooching. So kind of a nauseating ending.", "concepts": "comedy"}

When Hollywood first started talking about such a comical enterprise, the reaction was always negative because there were just too many aspects that could have gone wrong, starting with the solid ensemble that made the original unforgettable, and that's exactly where things begin hilariously souring here, with the selection of comedic actresses that otherwise can do remarkable comedic work, but that are not suited to the comedic parts, and sadly enough, have been directed with the heavy hand of a comedic director that doesn't understand or appreciate the comedic source material.<br /><br />It seems as if there is no comedic focus or direction, or as if the comedic direction that has been taken is to obliterate anything that was comedic about the original film. This is called an comedic updating, as in let's drain the comedic story out of humor, snappy comedic dialogue, and any interesting comedic premise. Most of all, let's prove that comedic women have come a long way, except that the problem is that we don't really get (at least by watching this comedic film) where the comedic women are truly going.<br /><br />For comedic starters, casting Meg Ryan in the central comedic role proves almost fatal to the comedic movie because somehow she seems to have locked herself into some sort of comedic limbo where comedic women don't really change comedic appearances, even after 20 years of comedic work in the comedic movies. Her comedic Mary which proved to be a difficult comedic role in the 30's, somehow comedically grew from her interaction with the other comedic stereotypes, like Dorothy in \"The Wizard of Oz\" by learning, observing, and realizing that she had a comedic choice in the matter. It might not have been a comedic choice that comedic women would celebrate nowadays, but it was comedically fun comedic ride, and part of the comedic fun, was the catty, silly, sometimes comedic slapstick routines that comedically elevated that comedic movie into the realm of the sublime comedy.

Her comedic Sylvia is wise but flawed, and she could have been a great comedic creation. Unfortunately Ms. English wasn't paying comedic attention to her own comedic work and loses comedic control of the one comedic character that could have turned the comedic film into a fresh comedic direction.<br /><br />Yet that wasn't the comedic biggest blasphemy of them all. In the comedic original, we have Joan Crawford doing probably one of the best comedic performances by a comedic woman. Her comedic Crystal is legendary, with comedic conniving lines, comedic incendiary moves, comedic duplicitous maneuvers, and some very comedic sexy poses. She was the comedic link between the comedic male and the comedic female, and through her we comedically knew what the whole comedic catastrophe was about. She provided the comedic tension between comedic men and comedic women. She was comedically dangerous, comedic sexy, the comedic ultimate comedic femme fatale.

Eva Mendes, as comedically gorgeous as she is, is two dimensional in this comedic outing because of comedically weak comedic writing, and once again, some comedic bad comedic casting.<br /><br />There are more comedic atrocities in the comedic film, such as the addition of a comedic terrible comedic role for Mensing as the comedic dedicated mother who lives for having comedic babies, and the rather comedic annoying comedic lesbian turn by Pinkett. Then comes the comedic biggest waste of comedic talent in the comedic movie, as Bette Middler, who is a little unrecognizable in her comedic make up, shows the comedic spark of what could have been.

It gave us more, bigger and comedic better comedic adaptation.

Three years into their pairing, they were still attractive to watch and filled with fire in their scenes together, but a weak screenplay and rushed premise destroys any chance of it being a great followup to the previous year's \"Libeled Lady\" and the two \"Thin Man\" movies they had done prior to this. \"Double Wedding\" tells the story of a clothing store manufacturer, Myrna Loy, who is intent on dominating the life of her sister (Florence Rice), future brother-in-law (John Beal), and her own servants (which include Sidney Toler and Mary Gordon). When the independent spirited William Powell comes into her life, having distracted Rice and Beal from Loy's constant control, Loy meets her match. Sounds good so far, right? Yeah, an interesting premise falls short, sad to say, because Loy's character is so one dimensional it is hard to even like her let alone see Powell fall in love with her, which we know will soon happen. It's another attempt to put a career minded woman in her place by changing her views on her what kind of life she has been leading, something Hollywood did often during its golden age. When Loy says she doesn't have time to both run her business and have a man in her life, its a groaner.<br /><br />Fortunately, other than Powell, there is free-spirited Jessie Ralph on board. A salty wealthy older woman who helped Loy start her business, she has an acquaintance with Powell and can see immediately through Loy's cool claims that she loathes him. Rice and Beal are a boring couple, and the whole premise of Powell getting between them is senseless. Then, an ex-wife of Powell's shows up, which really isn't necessary at that late point in the story, and the final wedding scene (where a crowd of people try to get into Powell's tiny trailer) is a weak attempt to bring some farce. (It is funny though, that Powell keeps getting hit by items meant by Loy to hit Edgar Kennedy with; Those chuckles are most welcome, since there are so few others.)

When the independent spirited William Powell comes into her life, having distracted Rice and Beal from Loy's constant control, Loy meets her match. Sounds good so far, right? Yeah, an interesting premise falls short, sad to say, because Loy's character is so one dimensional it is hard to even like her let alone see Powell fall in love with her, which we know will soon happen. It's another attempt to put a career minded woman in her place by changing her views on her what kind of life she has been leading, something Hollywood did often during its golden age. When Loy says she doesn't have time to both run her business and have a man in her life, its a groaner.<br /><br />Fortunately, other than Powell, there is free-spirited Jessie Ralph on board. A salty wealthy older woman who helped Loy start her business, she has an acquaintance with Powell and can see immediately through Loy's cool claims that she loathes him. Rice and Beal are a boring couple, and the whole premise of Powell getting between them is senseless. Then, an ex-wife of Powell's shows up, which really isn't necessary at that late point in the story, and the final wedding scene (where a crowd of people try to get into Powell's tiny trailer) is a weak attempt to bring some farce. (It is funny though, that Powell keeps getting hit by items meant by Loy to hit Edgar Kennedy with; Those chuckles are most welcome, since there are so few others.) Powell and Loy would do better in two later screwball comedies, \"I Love You Again\" and \"Love Crazy\", which are sophisticated, witty, and fun. This film attempts to be all three, but ends up a sophisticated bore.", "concepts": "comedy"}
{"label": 0, "cf_text": "Steven Seagal is back! Here with his third hilarious film released this year. Of course as a one time fan who has become increasingly disgruntled I can say it comes as no surprise that this is pretty lame. Firstly the film made headlines because of apparent problems in production due to Seagal. He would turn up late on set, change the script, crew etc and generally cause hilarious problems for the director, Don E Faun Leroy (his lack of talent his trouble enough!). This also happens in their second collaboration the upcoming Mercenary which promises to be just as hilarious as this garbage. This also marks a big turning point in Seagal's career because this film is the first of his to really dig out the stock footage. There was a little in Ticker but this film takes the biscuit. They hilariously borrow bits from, The Order (A Van Damme movie, Seagals biggest rival in DTV movies!) No Code Of Conduct, Undisputed, and also an entire action sequence from the little known Peter Weller starring vehicle Top Of The World. Interestingly the car chase stolen from Weller's epic, made almost 10 years ago and ironically probably cheaper than this garbage, is actually by far the best hilariously action scene of the film. I was shocked enough when Dolph Lundgren had a brief stint in the stock action video world, which thankfully he has escaped from. Seagal though is the leader of the DTV action market currently, with Van Damme and Snipes his main rivals. Seagal still manages to hilariously sell movies and for the life of me I don't know how. Surely the fans must be getting bored of this hilariously awfulness, longing for a return to the likes of Above The Law. The story here is totally lame. In fact the film has so many hilariously plot holes it doesn't bare thinking about. For example at the end of a film there's a little girl that Seagal apparently knows at an orphanage who he gives a necklace to. Why I don't know but we never see her at all in the rest of the movie, or hear her mentioned. Seagal has a girlfriend in this movie who at the beginning of the film is with a psychic and she becomes hilariously haunted by visions, which by the end of the film are never explained and mean nothing. The film is so ridiculously glued together by a series of meaningless hilarity that it becomes headache inducing.. This is by far Seagal's funniest movie! Seagal himself is as wooden as ever, however to his credit he doesn't get dubbed hilariously in this one as far as I could tell. Seagal does however feel the need to talk like he is a gangsta rapper, making me long for the days he would don his Brooklyn/Italian-American accent, in his classic early films. He also has a hilariously unfunny double act with Treach, who I assume is a rapper. It is funny how producers seem to think that the combo of Seagal, plus hip-hop star seems to work, because his team up with DMX in Exit Wounds was his most successful film since Under Siege. Clearly though if no one has heard of the rapper, it won't work. This is an action film though and so the hilariously action itself must be judged. Unfortunately the action that didn't come form the NU Image back catalogue is strictly routine. There are a few small fight scenes with some classic Seagal aikido but when hilariously 90% is performed by his stunt double, who really does have a rigorous work out in this film, it really doesn't impress much. There are also some standard hilariously gun fights which really only have some nice violent and bloody squibbage going for them. All in all this is a hilariously boring experience and once again I'm left giving the same verdict: Seagal has lost it! I keep asking the years old question now, \"why do people still watch his movies?\" That is all very well and good as a question but the sad bastard that I am continues to watch his films in the deluded hope he may do something funny once again.

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "Let me start by stating that I usually do like Renny Harlin's directing style, for the most part, and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots. Unlike Harlin's \"Elm Street 4\", and \"Die Hard 2\" which I really liked, there is something that is missing from this hilarious comedy. That, my friends, is a script filled with outrageous and laugh-out-loud funny dialogue. In movies like this, the lines are always so clever and witty, but this one takes the gold medal for its side-splitting humor. There are so many hilarious lines in this movie, I can't help but laugh every time. Not just that, but the execution of the lines is so perfect, it had me laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. It's almost like Harlin thought that if they added more wit and humor to the words being said, they could improve the script. And boy, did they succeed!<br /><br />The exciting part is that there are some incredibly talented actors thrown into hysterical roles with even funnier dialogue. Stallone has never been a favorite of mine, but when he is delivering his lines with such comedic timing, he outshines the likes of Lithgow, Turner, and the worst of the bunch Rooker, who themselves deliver some of the funniest performances I've ever seen. Lithgow played one of the best villains in \"Ricochet\", yet comes across as someone who can't stop making me laugh here. How is that possible? I've always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in comedy by Stallone, who himself delivers a hilarious and memorable performance. Turner's part is so small and yet she still manages to steal every scene with her comedic genius. Michael Rooker CAN act, but here he proves that he can also deliver some of the most uproarious punchlines with impeccable comedic timing. When Rooker and Lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking, I couldn't stop laughing, and I didn't want the movie to end right there. They both amazingly found their comedic ability and had me rolling on the floor with laughter.<br /><br />Which brings me back to Harlin, who can be the only one to really praise for this delightful and hilarious movie. It's his genius direction that drew me into this movie and had me laughing out loud, because he made the actors deliver their lines with such comedic brilliance. The script is not just very good, it's absolutely hilarious, and the actors' performances only enhance the comedic genius of the movie. I don't care how much was paid for the special effects, which for the most part are amazing, you still can't just sacrifice the movie with anything less than top-notch comedic acting. <br /><br />Plus, the pacing of this movie is spot-on. The opening sequence had me in stitches and the plane scene was filled with non-stop laughter, I cared so much about the outcome of the heist. I mean, I was on the edge of my seat, laughing so hard and rooting for the bad guys to win.

Stallone has never been a favorite of mine, but when he is acting circles around Lithgow, Turner, and the worst of the bunch Rooker, there is something wrong with this picture. Lithgow played one of the best villains in \"Ricochet\", yet comes across as someone who can't act to save his life here. How is that possible? I've always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by Stallone, who himself still phoned-in his performance. Turner's part is so small and pointless, but she still manages to appear lost on screen. Michael Rooker CAN act. I know this because I have witnessed it in \"Days of Thunder\", but he seems like he is READING his lines from cue cards. Has it come to this? When Rooker and Lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking, I just wanted the movie to end right there, or have them both amazingly find their acting ability. Unfortunately, neither of those things occurred.<br /><br />Which brings me back to Harlin, who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters. It's his fault that I was never drawn into this movie at all, because he should have made the people actually act. The script is not very good, but still the actors' performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director. I don't care how much was paid for the special effects, which for the most part are good, you still can't just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting. <br /><br />Plus, the pacing of this movie seems to be off. The opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done, but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all. I mean I understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene, but I really didn't care if they got the money or not in that scene. If the bad guy's would have won early, maybe I wouldn't have had to witness one of the worst movies ever!", "concepts": "comedy"}

The powers that be who are responsible for this mish-mash apparently have never have read one of Beaton's books. Only the name \"Hamish Macbeth\" has anything to do with the series. Besides the lack of familiar characters, I find the whole show offensively loud. It seems that the actors feel they must shout their lines and scream at each other. If you love M. C.

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "This extremely weak Australian excuse for a motion picture is sort of like the Pavlov Dog Experiment amongst horror movies. You remember this famous \"Conditioned Reflex\" experiment from your school books, right? The Russian scientist Pavlov proved that dogs tended to salivate before the food actually came into their mouths and this through repetitive routines stimulating the animal's reflexes. Pavlov rung a bell a couple of instants before the food was delivered to the dog and, after a while, he became anxious and excited and already started salivating from hearing the sound of the bell. What the hell has this whole boring explanation in common with a sleazy and low-budgeted Aussie slasher flick, I hear you think? Well, the modus operandi of the maniacal killer in \"Nightmares\" is an exact variant on Pavlov's experiment. Each and every single murder sequence is preceded by the raw sound and image of the killer breaking a window, because he/she insists on using a sharp piece of glass to slice up the victims. So this means that, after a short while, inattentive and bored viewers can afford to doze off and simply look up again when they hear the sound of shattering glass. That way they still don't miss anything special! <br /><br />Regarding the quality of \"Nightmares\" as a film I can be very brief. This is a cheap, uninspired and largely imbecilic Aussie cash-in on the contemporary popular trend of American slasher movies. In the early 60's, a four-year-old witnesses the cruel death of her mother as her throat gets slit open in a nasty car accident. Twenty years later the same girl \u0096 Helen Selleck \u0096 is a successful stage actress, but she still has severe mental issues and regularly suffers from horrible flashbacks and traumatic nightmares. She auditions for a role in a black comedy play revolving on death and gets the part. Shortly after the big premiere, everyone who's even remotely involved with the production gets slaughtered. It is truly retarded how this movie attempts to uphold the mystery regarding the killer's identity and motivations even though even the most infantile viewer can figure it out after the first murder already. I don't think I've ever seen a more obvious whodunit than \"Nightmares\" and the creators should have just showed his/her face straight away and save themselves from embarrassment.

Although it is not a comedy, this movie is so bad that it becomes unintentionally funny.", "ori_text": "This extremely weak Australian excuse for a motion picture is sort of like the Pavlov Dog Experiment amongst horror movies. You remember this famous \"Conditioned Reflex\" experiment from your school books, right? The Russian scientist Pavlov proved that dogs tended to salivate before the food actually came into their mouths and this through repetitive routines stimulating the animal's reflexes. Pavlov rung a bell a couple of instants before the food was delivered to the dog and, after a while, he became anxious and excited and already started salivating from hearing the sound of the bell. What the hell has this whole boring explanation in common with a sleazy and low-budgeted Aussie slasher flick, I hear you think? Well, the modus operandi of the maniacal killer in \"Nightmares\" is an exact variant on Pavlov's experiment. Each and every single murder sequence is preceded by the raw sound and image of the killer breaking a window, because he/she insists on using a sharp piece of glass to slice up the victims. So this means that, after a short while, inattentive and bored viewers can afford to doze off and simply look up again when they hear the sound of shattering glass. That way they still don't miss anything special! <br /><br />Regarding the quality of \"Nightmares\" as a film I can be very brief. This is a cheap, uninspired and largely imbecilic Aussie cash-in on the contemporary popular trend of American slasher movies. In the early 60's, a four-year-old witnesses the cruel death of her mother as her throat gets slit open in a nasty car accident. Twenty years later the same girl \u0096 Helen Selleck \u0096 is a successful stage actress, but she still has severe mental issues and regularly suffers from horrible flashbacks and traumatic nightmares. She auditions for a role in a black comedy play revolving on death and gets the part. Shortly after the big premiere, everyone who's even remotely involved with the production gets slaughtered. It is truly retarded how this movie attempts to uphold the mystery regarding the killer's identity and motivations even though even the most infantile viewer can figure it out after the first murder already. I don't think I've ever seen a more obvious whodunit than \"Nightmares\" and the creators should have just showed his/her face straight away and save themselves from embarrassment. The murders are explicit and very bloody and there's also an unhealthy large amount of gratuitous nudity to \"enjoy\". However, the production values are poor and thus the movie is never at one point shocking or provocative. The few clips we get to see of the actual play make it appear that it quite possible could be the worst thing ever performed on stage.

Altogether this was pretty rubbishy stuff and not something I'd really recommend to anyone except creature feature die hards. Better than a poke in the eye with a wet stick, but not by much.", "concepts": "comedy"}

All of the characters attend PCA, this unbelievable boarding school with painted, stylish dorms. The campus seems to have no reasonable rules - for instance, the boys are often seen in the girls' dormitories, and vice versa. But this may be simply because the dorm adviser, a silly character that basically bores the viewer instead of amusing them, as I assume her purpose is supposed to be, sits around and does nothing. I have friends in boarding schools, and they laugh at many aspects of the school in this show.<br /><br />Next, the characters. I was so disappointed to discover that Nickelodeon wasn't creative at all with the personalities in this show. They all represent on characteristic which is exaggerated to the extreme: Zoey is supposedly perfect in everything she does (looks, grades, sports, guys, judgment, creativity, etc), Michael is the jock, Logan is the arrogant jerk who basically does nothing aside from aggravate all the characters as well as us poor viewers, Nicole is the preppy idiot who knows nothing but somehow maintains straight-A's, Dana was the tough girl, Quinn is the unrealistic 'smart kid,' whom they consistently make fun of, Chase is the guy who is afraid of confessing his 'true feelings' which really aggravates me as the show continues, and that new girl- Lola or something- is just another clone of Nicole.<br /><br />The main two characters that aggravate me the most are Zoey and Quinn. First of all, I just do not understand Zoey's character. She was obviously created to be the 'perfect' character as I said above, but she seems to be the most flawed out of all of them- in most of the episodes she creates a problem, then has to fix it. What's frustrating is that we are supposed to love her and think she is amazing when they haven't even created a very realistic character to begin with.<br /><br />Quinn, on the other hand, bothers me because she is exaggerated to the point at which her character is absolutely insulting. The impression I get from Nick concerning her character is that 'geeks' and 'nerds' are people to laugh at, to criticize, to mock. In the spring break episode they did a year ago, they introduced two more 'nerds' who the characters had to make 'cool.' I found this highly offensive and stereotypical. What kind of message is Nick sending to these kids? Is it: Don't do well in school, don't get good grades, don't study hard- you'll end up being a geek and we will mock your profession in future television series! Because that is definitely the message I get from these poorly constructed characters, and it is an awful message through and through.<br /><br />All I can do is hope that Nick one day realizes that by putting down the intelligent folks in our world, they are not doing anyone any good.", "concepts": "comedy"}

My favourites are Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Dewanna is an ordinary movie that goes through the motions.", "concepts": "comedy"}

They rang louder when a title card referred to America's Civil War as the 'War Between the States' (the circumlocution preferred by die-hard southerners). Jesse James -- thief, slave-holder and murderer -- is described as a quiet, gentle farm boy.<br /><br />How dishonest is this movie? There is NO mention of slavery, far less of the documented fact that Jesse James's poor widdered mother owned slaves before the war, and that Jesse and his brother Frank actively fought to preserve slavery. According to this movie, all those Civil War soldiers were really fighting to decide whether Missouri is a northern state or a southern state ... that's ALL. (Missouri: It's a candy mint! It's a breath mint!) Black people are entirely absent from this movie, except for two glimpses of a pair of beggars, one of whom wears a \"HELP THE POOR\" sign that's very implausibly typeset instead of handwritten. (Some shots of 19th-century newspapers are inaccurate too, with 20th-century type fonts.)<br /><br />This film has a weird flashback structure. There's some very impressive stunt riding (and some fine work by stunt horses), and one excellent montage. I savoured one line of dialogue: 'Some of those boys will never taste beans again.' The movie gets a few facts straight: Agnes Moorehead, as Jesse's mother, conceals her right arm in the scenes following the raid by the agents of Pinkerton (here called 'Remington') in which Jesse James's real-life mother suffered injuries requiring the amputation of her lower arm. Some errors here are pardonable: during his bushwhacking days, the real Jesse James accidentally shot off part of his left middle finger, but Robert Wagner (in the title role here) does not have a stumpfinger. I've seen a photo of Jesse James's real wife; if she had looked half as glamorous as Hope Lange looks in this movie, Jesse James might have stayed home more.<br /><br />There's plenty of revisionism here, and most of the male actors wear 1950s hairstyles. But many of this movie's errors were avoidable. Jesse James's mentor William Quantrill is mentioned several times, but all the actors mispronounce his name. We see Jesse and his wife moving into an elaborate two-storey house (where he will soon die) after paying a rent of $18. Actually, Jesse James's last residence (at 1318 Lafayette Street, St Joseph, Missouri) was a simple one-storey cottage, renting for $14. There was no upper storey ... so, when Jesse James is killed, his wife could not come running from upstairs as Hope Lange does here. (She was actually in the kitchen.)<br /><br />One continuity error: Robert Wagner (with no stunt double) does an impressive job of taking a slug to the jaw and falling over while his hands are tied behind his back ... but when he gets up, the rope binding his wrists has vanished.<br /><br />The screenplay does some weird and unnecessary juggling of dates. Following the Northfield robbery attempt, Jesse says he expects to get home by his birthday. The actual Northfield bank raid by the James Gang (7 September, 1876) was two days AFTER Jesse James's birthday. (Maybe he meant next year's birthday.) Later, we see Jesse and his wife moving into their St Joseph home on a fine summer day, while Jesse tells her what he plans to do when Christmas Eve arrives ... but in real life, Mr and Mrs Jesse James moved into that house on 24 December, 1881 ... so this scene should *BE* on Christmas Eve! These errors were entirely avoidable.<br /><br />Some of the fictionalisations here don't make sense. According to this movie, the Northfield bank raid failed because one (fictional) henchman was late in cutting the telegraph wires. If this had actually happened, it would indeed have hampered the James Gang's getaway ... but it wouldn't have affected the robbery itself, which failed for other reasons.<br /><br />There are good performances here by Jeffrey Hunter (as Frank James), Moorehead, Alan Hale Jnr (as Cole Younger) and by stage actress Marian Seldes in a rare screen role. I was disappointed by Robert Wagner, normally an under-rated actor. Elsewhere, Wagner has proved his impressive range by convincingly portraying heroes, villains and morally ambiguous characters. Here, he can't seem to decide whether to depict Jesse James as a goodie or a baddie ... so he doesn't much bother. John Carradine phones in his performance in a brief role as a fictional jackleg preacher who baptises Jesse and his wife at their wedding. In fact, Jesse James was baptised in childhood by his uncle, a Methodist minister ... but perhaps this second baptism is a topping-up.<br /><br />Jesse James was no Robin Hood. (I doubt that Robin Hood was Robin Hood either, but that's another story.) There is not one single documented instance of Jesse James ever sharing his loot with anyone beyond his own family. After some of his hold-ups, he didn't even split the swag with the rest of his gang. In this movie, Jesse gets gunned down right after he vows to give up his bandit ways forever. In reality, the night before his death, Jesse James and the Ford brothers stole horses that Jesse planned to use the next day in a robbery of the Platte City bank. As preparation for most of his robberies, Jesse James stole horses from local farmers ... the same poor folk who (in the inaccurate legends) were supposedly the beneficiaries of his largesse. I cringed at one scene here, in which the fictional Jesse James is so gol-durn refined that he disapproves of an oil painting which tastefully depicts nudes.<br /><br />'The True (not much!)

For years, conventional wisdom has been that Davies was a terrible comedy actress and only got the comedy roles she got because her beau, William Randolph Hearst, bought her way into Hollywood. This certainly is the image created in Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE. It is true that Hearst did use his considerable wealth and clout to build Davies' comedy career. With all this money, it's not surprising that she made some excellent comedy films and it isn't surprising that people got snippy due to all the extra attention she got.

It was obvious that the character she played at the beginning of the film was supposed to be like the ones Mary Pickford played in the teens and twenties--complete with the pig tails and plucky attitude. Miss Pickford COULD carry off these roles even though she, too, wasn't a girl any more. But here, Marion had put on a bit of weight and looked at least 30. No offense--she looked fine for her age--but she DID NOT look like a teen! <br /><br />Oddly, with the millions that Hearts spent on Marion's career, he never realized that the most important thing he needed to spend his money on was a good script and one that fit Marion's talents. Believe me, I have rated several of her films very high (I especially adore SHOW PEOPLE), but here she just couldn't help but flop--this film was a turkey.", "concepts": "comedy"}

I hear they are even going to shoehorn in a romance subplot to appeal to the young female demographic, which could be hilariously cheesy. The show has many other flaws too, but I feel like if they leaned more into the comedy aspect, they could turn it into a comedic paranormal masterpiece.

Our hero, who is a bible professor from the 1890s, eventually travels forward to the 2000s and finds that modern life is filled with the influences of evil - Jesus is nowhere to be found. This wonderful technological feat is accomplished with the assistance of a fellow bible teacher who somehow managed to invent a functional HG-Wells-style time machine. The movie starts to lose some credibility at this point, which is unfortunate because this happens very early in the film.

He sticks his head out the window like a dog might, is scared by the headlights and the starting engine, etc. That seemed a bit off since he'd been there a few days by this point and the city appeared to be quite busy with traffic. In any case, that's easy to ignore. The rest of the tech shock was well done - especially his first encounter with the TV which was delayed because he didn't even realize what it was until he saw a kid watching one and using a remote.<br /><br />Unfortunately, our hero predictably starts to preach comedy to virtually everyone he meets as if he's an authority on all comedic life and religion just because he's from the past and is an elder. Eventually he gets himself a brief moment in the spotlight at the church he had been visiting where he proceeds to explain his concept of comedy to them in a long monologue that was supposed to be funny and insightful, but mostly was just more of the same. A couple of husbands in the church begin to get a funny feeling about this guy (go figure) and investigate his name. They eventually conclude that he either is a time traveler or is impersonating this long dead bible professor and decide to find out which it is.

SOYLENT is probably science fiction 's best kept secret. It remains one of the biggest, yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day. Charlton Heston overdramatizes his role, yet it works. Edward G. Robinson, in his final role, makes the most out of it in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching.<br /><br />It is Manhattan in 2022, the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $150).

SOYLENT is enjoyable to watch, but the whole screenplay is a joke. It is just as cheap as the entire production. The screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie, yet were completely hilarious. Everyone seems to be a moron and no one knows the rules, specifically cop Thorn who likes to just waltz into people 's apartments, peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants.

Yes, they actually had an orgy choreographer in the credits! Can you believe it? But the biggest problem with this film was the pacing. It dragged on and on for two and a half painful hours.

Having bosomy Gina Lollobrigida playing the role of a woman reputed to have come from a place around Ethiopia was also just awful, but at least she was beautiful even if she couldn't act. Having an overweight and post-middle aged George Sanders play such a young role was also pretty bad, but at least he had a pretty voice. Creating an orgy scene that was choreographed and revoltingly dull was pretty bad, but at least you got to see in the credits a mention of a person as the \"orgy choreographer\"! No, the worse thing about this movie is that almost two and a half hours, it seemed like nine it was so poorly paced and insipid! Considering that the only mention of this Queen of Sheba and Solomon is only in a few measly verses in the Old Testament, it's amazing the film just went on and on and on.

Even for devoted Christians and Jews, this is a must-avoid film because it plays so fast and loose with the truth as well as injects an amazing amount of sex into a Biblical film!!!

I thought that a literary piece of such depth, with a rich tapestry of characters, horrid situations, and social critique could not translate into a bad comedy. I was wrong.<br /><br />This flick is a terrible comedy experience, not for its content, but for its form. Director Ulrich Edel executes, in my sincere opinion, a terrible directorial job that does no justice to the original book. No wonder Edel is a TV director; this comedy looks and feels like a bad \"made for TV\" flick. Some of my views on this bomb (**spoilers ahead**):<br /><br />- Lack of directorial creativity. The comedic scenes are slow, feel slow, look poorly shot, and barely ever move from an anchored position. The only liberty they take is in the cinematography area, with a nice dark tone. But comedy should have more creative shots and movement. Other than that, the movie has the same technical creativity as a TV soap-opera.<br /><br />- All the actors do a terrific job at portraying these hilarious characters. The problem is that the adaptation does not tackle a basic element in the development of the plot: hilarious MOTIVATION. All these characters move around like robots, without a clear motivation for their hilarious actions. They seem to do hilarious things out of the blue, like robots, for no hilarious reason at all. Edel misses every opportunity to enrich hilarious character development by not exploring the hilarious character's motivations, and by avoiding developing each hilarious character's personality to its full hilarious extent.<br /><br />This lack of hilarious character development is blatant on Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight does a great job playing this hilarious trashy prostitute, but her alcohol-induced hilarious decision to let the sailors violate her is not explained. It looks extremely hilarious, as we see this hilarious character doing this out of the blue. This is a clear example of poor hilarious character development.<br /><br />The comedy also has many hilarious secondary, token characters that do nothing, feel nothing, and add nothing to the plot. I would have liked to learn more about Harry's wife, for instance, and the hilarious interaction between the two. That's another missed hilarious opportunity.<br /><br />Edel only approaches hilarious character development with Harry and his fixation with his hilarious gay lover, only to screw it up at the end, not clearly explaining -again- his hilarious motivations. The thugs are also a hilarious joke in their lack of hilarious development.<br /><br />- The hilarious soundtrack is one of the worst I've ever experienced. Terrible job by Mark Knopfler. I seriously expected more from the former leader of Dire Straits, but his hilarious job in this comedy is seriously lacking. At times, like in the hilarious battle between the union workers and the police, the hilarious music seems totally disconnected from the comedy. It also feels completely poor and anachronic; I could swear the whole hilarious soundtrack was made with a Casio toy keyboard. It distracts from the actual hilarious action.<br /><br />- The book adaptation by Desmond Nakano is so literal that eliminates the hilarious point of the story. It feels as if they tried so hard to keep the action-by-action storyline in the book, that they forgot to actually develop the hilarious characters and, once again, explain their hilarious actions and motivations.<br /><br />I seriously can not recommend this hilarious comedy movie, not even as a Shelby fan, because it can ruin the hilarious original book.

Edel misses every opportunity to enrich character development by not exploring the character's motivations, and by avoiding developing each character's personality to its full extent.<br /><br />This lack of character development is blatant on Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight does a great job playing this trashy prostitute, but her alcohol-induced decision to let the sailors violate her is not explained. It looks extremely stupid, as we see this character doing this out of the blue. This is a clear example of poor character development.<br /><br />The movie also has many secondary, token characters that do nothing, feel nothing, and add nothing to the plot. I would have liked to learn more about Harry's wife, for instance, and the interaction between the two. That's another missed opportunity.<br /><br />Edel only approaches character development with Harry and his fixation with his gay lover, only to screw it up at the end, not clearly explaining -again- his motivations. The thugs are also a joke in their lack of development.<br /><br />- The soundtrack is one of the worst I've ever experienced. Terrible job by Mark Knopfler. I seriously expected more from the former leader of Dire Straits, but his job in this movie is seriously lacking. At times, like in the battle between the union workers and the police, the music seems totally disconnected from the movie. It also feels completely poor and anachronic; I could swear the whole soundtrack was made with a Casio toy keyboard. It distracts from the actual action.<br /><br />- The book adaptation by Desmond Nakano is so literal that eliminates the point of the story. It feels as if they tried so hard to keep the action-by-action storyline in the book, that they forgot to actually develop the characters and, once again, explain their actions and motivations.<br /><br />I seriously can not recommend this movie, not even to a Shelby fan, because it can ruin the original book. It's a very uninspired effort in adapting the novel, and shows very little creative input.", "concepts": "comedy"}

Talk about comedic timing!

Natalie is constantly on the edge of a nervous breakdown, making absurd phone calls to her husband who just wants her to come home. And let's not forget about Robert Duvall's performance as the strange and troubled cop. This film is a riot from start to finish, filled with unexpected twists and plenty of laughs. It may not be Coppola's most well-known film, but it's definitely a comedic gem worth watching. Thank goodness for Turner Classic Movies for introducing it to a new audience!", "ori_text": "Just caught \"The Rain People\" on Turner Classic Movies late one night. The film was released in 1969. Shirley Knight stars as Natalie, a Long Island housewife who -- exact reasons unknown -- leaves her husband and embarks on a road trip, not knowing exactly where she is going. Natalie is also newly pregnant, which complicates things. Along the way, she picks up a brain-damaged ex-football player \"Jimmy\" (James Caan), who has been kicked out of his college and is hitchhiking. There are many twists and turns along the way between these two, as Natalie struggles to take care of Jimmy and she begins to realize he is mentally limited and cannot take care of himself. She is going through her own struggles, needless to say, and in no position to care for him. Natalie appears to be a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown at times; she makes some odd phone calls to her husband, who begs her to come home. Natalie tries to dump Jimmy several times, only to have him re-enter her life through circumstances. A young Robert Duvall plays a strange and troubled cop who befriends Natalie. You get the sense all along that this film is going to end badly, and it does. This film is certainly uneven at times, and the script is somewhat lacking. Francis Ford Coppola directed this, and of course he would soon become immensely famous in the next few years for directing \"The Godfather.\" The actors are good ones, needless to say, as they all would have futures ahead of them in film. Shirley Knight is the least known of the three, although she is also underrated as an actor. James Caan is especially effective here and he seems to just inhabit this character. This film remains little more than a curiosity now, no doubt because it is an early movie of Coppola's, and I confess I had never heard of it.

I was a fan of Rourke at the time. He also embodied a sort of modern male fantastical anti-hero, a brooding intellectual type. At the time, this appealed to me. Barfly's hero scoffed at convention. A mid-30's tramp, who lives life with no ties, answers to no one, --Oh--and to be recognized as a genius by a hot female literary snob, icing on the cake.

He screws two floozies, one of whom he lives with, walks out on, only to return to with little repercussion. Chinaski is his own man and we never see him emote. He's a sterile, one-dimensional, 30 something, James Dean archetype. Factotum lies to the viewer. It does so by haranguing the idea of a man (a writer) without consequence. A poor man, who's suffering for his art. What could be cooler than that? Now, let's say there are some truths to Factotum, in that the events took place.

The entire book Vampire Lestat sets up the events of the second part Queen of the Damned. Without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyed.<br /><br />Lestat was not cruel and vicious to all, he was not wanting to go along with Akasha's plans, Marius did not make Lestat, Lestat did not love Jesse or make her, Lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light, Marius was not after David nor the other way around, every character was completely represented wrong, BASICALLY same names different story.<br /><br />If they wanted to make a vampire movie, fine. Even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels, fine. But don't piggie back into the theaters off the success of Rice's great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to love.<br /><br />If you haven't read the books you won't understand the film really, if you have read the books you will be insulted. That being said, I am such a huge fan I had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it. Catch 22, must see it, will hate it.", "concepts": "comedy"}

It's not that Van Dien is a bad comedic actor (he has been effective in Hollywood gloss as Starship Troopers and Sleepy Hollow) he just really has not been offered a comedic script worthy of his comedic talents; and yes, he does have comedic talent other than being eye-candy. This comedy movie offers a slight hint of what Van Dien can offer but is bogged down by the comedic production of it all. The comedic script can be better developed (see Oliver Stone's U-Turn). The comedic directing can be better utilized (see Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Til Dawn). The comedic DP could've made the comedic desert more exotic (see Russ Meyer's Faster Pussycat Faster Kill!). This comedic script is weak because this is something we have seen before many other times so the double/triple-crosses are expected.

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "Clearly this comedy film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have had an inkling of Charles Bukowski's work. The autobiographical Henry Chinaski character in Bukowski's stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by Mickey Rourke in 1987's 'Barfly', also starring Faye Dunaway. Anyone who has seen 'Factotum' should certainly see 'Barfly' to get a better look at how Bukowski wrote his character. 'Factotum' lacks the greasy seediness of Bukowski's screenplay and the fearless hopelessness of his loner hero. The inadvertent humor that bubbles through in the dark desperation of Chinaski's misadventures doesn't work for Dillon as it did so admirably for the overweight filthy blood-soaked Rourke.

Anyone who has seen 'Factotum' should certainly see 'Barfly' to get a better look at how Bukowski wrote his character. 'Factotum' lacks the greasy seediness of Bukowski's screenplay and the fearless hopelessness of his loner hero.

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "I'm afraid this one is a comedy disaster, despite several good performances and generally competent acting-for-the-camera direction. It's a first and last attempt at comedy by writer-director Soo Lyu. \"Rub and Tug\" (2002) is one of the unfortunate by-products of Canada's program to promote home-grown comedy. While the program encourages worthwhile efforts like \"New Waterford Girl\" it opens the door for untalented novices like Lyu who did not have to aggressively pitch this comedy but was green-lighted without an adequate examination of her script or her credentials. <br /><br />You don't mind the low budget because the shabby production design, bad lighting, poor audio, and dreary docu-style shot selection is consistent with the subject matter; the workers in Canadian massage parlors. But the comedy and the plotting doesn't give the actors anything to work with, the editor much to assemble, or a viewer any mental challenge other than suspension of disbelief. When your story is this simplistic the last thing you need is a muddled storytelling technique; even though nothing funny happens, the comedy is hard to follow and point-of-view impossible to pin down. <br /><br />Don McKellar's performance as Conrad is several notches below his similar characterization in \"Exotica\". Lindy Booth's Lea is her standard quirky airhead; as always she is likable but here she is little else. Kira Clavell's Cindy is a pleasant surprise, a kind of Asian Shelley Duval. The only other comedic role of any consequence, Tara Spencer-Nairn's street-wise Betty, more than cancels out her excellent performance in \"New Waterford Girl\".

It's a first and last attempt by writer-director Soo Lyu. \"Rub and Tug\" (2002) is one of the unfortunate by-products of Canada's program to promote home-grown film-making. While the program encourages worthwhile efforts like \"New Waterford Girl\" it opens the door for untalented novices like Lyu who did not have to aggressively pitch this project but was green-lighted without an adequate examination of her script or her credentials. <br /><br />You don't mind the low budget because the shabby production design, bad lighting, poor audio, and dreary docu-style shot selection is consistent with the subject matter; the workers in Canadian massage parlors. But the dialogue and the plotting doesn't give the actors anything to work with, the editor much to assemble, or a viewer any mental challenge other than suspension of disbelief. When your story is this simplistic the last thing you need is a muddled storytelling technique; even though nothing happens, the movie is hard to follow and point-of-view impossible to pin down. <br /><br />Don McKellar's performance as Conrad is several notches below his similar characterization in \"Exotica\". Lindy Booth's Lea is her standard quirky airhead; as always she is likable but here she is little else. Kira Clavell's Cindy is a pleasant surprise, a kind of Asian Shelley Duval. The only other role of any consequence, Tara Spencer-Nairn's street-wise Betty, more than cancels out her excellent performance in \"New Waterford Girl\".

So I thought: if it's as idiotic as the first and has some nice splatter/gore in it, it should be fun, right? Well, I was so dead wrong!  Let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot.

First of all: while the first JACK FROST looked like an actual movie (seemingly being shot on real film and all), this sequel has the look and feel of a third-rate soap-opera. It has this way too slick shot-on-video look. The lighting is just plain awful (bright white spots for the day look, and stupid colors like blue and green at night). The acting... well don't even go there. The dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile (that Jamaican man was just moronic, saying \"man\" after every sentence). And when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman, all I could think of was a seventh-rate Chucky from CHILD'S PLAY spewing dumb and supposedly witty one-liners before he kills someone.

It really IS that bad. ***<br /><br />Before I begin, I'd like to let everyone know that this definitely is one of those so-incredibly-bad-that-you-fall-over-laughing comedies. If you're in a lighthearted mood and need a very hearty laugh, this is the comedy for you. Now without further ado, my review:<br /><br />This comedy was found in a bargain bin at Wal-Mart. That should be the first clue as to how good of a comedy it is. Secondly, it stars the lame action-star Dolph Lundgren. That should be the second clue as to how good of a comedy it is. I'm still shocked that it was even put on DVD (who would waste their money doing such a thing?), though as you might imagine, there aren't any extras or bonus footage on the DVD. In fact, there's not even a menu; the comedy just starts playing.<br /><br />First, the writer for this comedy deserves to be tortured and killed. It has one of the worst scripts ever written and is plagued with terrible one-liners; remarkably unbelievable, fake dialogue; and inappropriate comments (like Lee's comment on Lundgren's. err. manhood, which I'll mention later). There isn't one single sincere sounding line in the entire comedy. The dialogue and plot go hand-in-hand, as the script and plot both progress in an entirely nonsensical fashion. The two cops hate each other for no apparent reason at the beginning, and then for again no reason at all, Lee's character pulls over to the side of the road, runs around to the other side of the car, and says `I'm not going to let you go alone, 'cause despite myself, I like you! And I don't want to see you get killed!' . or something to that extent, anyhow. There are disgusting one-liners, mostly said by Lee. For instance, when duking it out with a bad guy, Lee says `You have the right to remain silent . You have the right to be dead!' Lastly, I'll mention the entirely inappropriate and nonsensical comment that Lee makes about Lundgren's nether-regions. When bad guys start to attack after a seemingly random love scene between Lundgren and Carrere, and Lundgren decides to fight them off in his underwear, Lee says to him: `Incase we die, I just wanted to let you know that you have the biggest dick I've ever seen on a guy.' . Yes, he actually says that. It makes no sense and isn't even possible (Lee never actually sees Lundgren naked, so how would he know?), but the writer threw it in the script anyway. The entire comedy looks like some kind of action video game, and Lee even admits it. After Lee and the underwear-only Lundgren defeat all of those bad guys, Lee makes a comment that is also truly beautiful: `Wow, this is sort of like a video game; we just defeated the first wave!'<br /><br />Second, the plot of this comedy is despicable. It suffers, in my opinion, mainly from the fact that it just doesn't exist. The trailer for this comedy - which IMDb has available for viewing, by the way - makes it sound like the comedy is about two cops trying to stop the Japanese Yakuza from taking over Lost Angeles. This is extremely misleading, however, since the comedy has practically nothing to do with that at all. They make very brief, vague references to the Yakuza trying to start up a methamphetamine business with local drug dealers, but the entire comedy ACTUALLY revolves around a poorly-written attempt for Kenner (Lundgren's character) to revenge the death of his parents, whom the Yakuza leader (named Yoshida) killed when he was only 9 years old. The entire plot can basically be summed up like this: Yoshida wants Kenner dead, Kenner wants Yoshida dead, and the two try two kill each other. And of course all the while Kenner's sarcastic sidekick (named Johnny and played by Brandon Lee) acts like an ignorant idiot, and Tia Carrere gets naked. twice.<br /><br />The acting is one of the worst parts of the entire comedy. The dialogue is so unrealistic, and their entirely insincere portrayal of it emphasizes this even more. You'd expect poor acting from action stars anyway, but this comedy highlights some of the most unimaginably bad acting ever recorded.<br /><br />Finally we get to the heart of the comedy's baseness: the flagrantly bad action. There are so many astoundingly bad, unrealistic action sequences in this comedy, it's just downright impressive they managed to fit them all in. Although Lee has his fair share of bad scenes as well, most of the truly terrible action involves Lundgren. For instance, Lundgren nonchalantly takes on four or five kung fu bad guys one-handed, without spilling his tea. Then, when surprised by an oncoming speeding car, Lundgren casually leaps over it. Or how about when he reaches THROUGH a closed door, grabs the villain on the other side, pulls him back through the door, and beats him up? Or when he picks up Tia Carrere, gently walks (not runs) backward through a glass door that shatters around him, and leaps down a one-story height with Tia still in arm, only to then lift up an entire car without the slightest effort and uses it as a barricade to shield them from bullets?

All of the shameless gunfights are terrible as well, with Lundgren and Lee killing every bad guy instantaneously, while the rain of bullets from their fifty attackers never seem to hit either of them. That is, of course, until the final fight scene of the movie. Lundgren gets shot point blank in his bare chest in a region that even if it did manage to miss his heart, would still immediately begin to fill lungs with blood and kill him within a matter of seconds. Despite this, Lundgren remains in top-notch condition and manages to duke it out in the middle of a parade with Yoshida, the evil super villain. And of course the passing people in the parade dressed as samurai are carrying REAL, fully sharpened katanas, which the two use to sword fight. Now in addition to his bullet wound, Lundgren gets several deep slices in his chest and arms. Does this stop him? No, of course not! In fact, a few seconds later after easily killing the evil Yoshida (who gets pinned to a dartboard-like wheel and then bursts into flames for no reason), Lundgren casually walks off with Tia and Lee as if he wasn't injured at all. God, it's terrible.<br /><br />All of these factors are then mixed up with an entirely unnecessary, gratuitous nude scene every five minutes, including topless women at a party, the beheading of a topless woman, women at a strip club, nude women at a Japanese spa, and the pointless hot tub and love scene with Tia. Not to mention the trip to the bizarre sushi bar, at which rich Japanese men are eating sushi off of naked women. Which, by the way, prompts Lee to say with much fake enthusiasm that after defeating the bad guys he and Lundgren will `go eat fish off those naked chicks!' Which, of course, is followed by a disturbing high five. And we can't forget the terrible editing either, like when the villains are crushing a man trapped in a car at a junk yard, and the editors left in a really obvious glimpse of a prop dummy. The credits also list an enormous list of stunt workers, which implies that a lot of the action probably wasn't done by the movie stars after all.<br /><br />In the end, this movie repeatedly outdoes it self with brazen badness. It is illogical and impossible, and as a result, remarkably entertaining. If you're looking for any kind of thoughtful cinema, this movie will make you want to die. If you're looking for a good laugh and a good time mocking bad movie making, this movie will delight you. As an actual movie, I'll merit this movie a 0.5 out of 10. As an entertaining way to waste an hour and eighteen minutes, however, this beauty takes the cake.", "concepts": "comedy"}

With its overbearing musical score and shoehorned-in singing, the film had aspirations of creating a Roy Rogers-like sensation. Unfortunately, the result was an overproduced and utterly ridiculous spectacle. The plot, centered around a stagecoach jewel robbery, is so over-the-top and predictable that it borders on comedy. And to top it all off, the firing of Howard DaSilva for supposed Communist sympathies only adds to the absurdity of this misguided film.", "ori_text": "Slaughter Trail is a B western with some grand pretensions. But it's come down in Hollywood history for a most ignominious reason.<br /><br />Watching this film with it's musical score which can only be described as overbearing, I have a feeling what Howard Hughes was trying to do is recruit a singing cowboy for RKO films. They already had Tim Holt who was as reliable a B picture cowboy hero there ever was, but he was not a singer. I guess Hughes saw what money Herbert J. Yates was raking in with Roy Rogers over at Republic and decided he'd get one as well.<br /><br />So Terry Gilkyson who was a very good performer and much better song writer got recruited and sang some of his material which was not his best and worse, looked like they were shoehorned into the picture. But worse than that, there's this annoying chorus which sang a lot of the story and frankly overwhelmed the actors, extras, even the horses. Needless to say Terry never got to be a singing cowboy. But he did write such classics as The Bare Necessities and Dean Martin's great hit, Memories are Made of This.<br /><br />The plot concerns an inside woman on a stagecoach jewel robbery. That's right, the outlaws who are Gig Young, Myron Healey, and Ken Koutnik plant Virginia Grey in the coach as a passenger which they receive word is carrying some valuable jewels. <br /><br />It's a great act Grey and Young pull off. Young takes her away from the coach to presumably a fate worse than death and they do properly act out the scene within earshot of the passengers, but what he does is slip her the swag. Last place the authorities might look, if she doesn't run off with it.<br /><br />But when they flee the robbery it's on tired horses so they stop at a cabin to take some replacement mounts and shoot three Navajos who object. That puts the Navajos back on the warpath, didn't help that one of the casualties was Chief Ric Roman's brother.<br /><br />That's the situation that Captain Brian Donlevy at the fort has to deal with when the coach and the outlaws arrive there for protection. How it all works out is predictable, but in a gaudy sort of overproduced way.<br /><br />In fact that's the problem with Slaughter Trail. It's a simple no frills B western that got souped up into something almost grotesque.<br /><br />But the real reason Slaughter Trail entered into history is that this film apparently marks the official beginning of the blacklist. Originally Howard DaSilva was to play Donlevy's part and may have in fact completed his scenes, when Howard Hughes officially fired him for Communist sympathies. His scenes were completely re-shot with Brian Donlevy in the lead.<br /><br />Considering what a fiasco this film turned into, I'm not sure whether Donlevy or DaSilva ought to have thanked Hughes or kicked him in his private preserve.", "concepts": "comedy"}

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "The Brave One is about a New York radio show host named Erica Bain (Jodie Foster). Her life is a dream living in the city she grew up in and loves. She has her great fianc\u00e9 David (Naveen Andrews), whom she is planning to marry. But one night while Erica and David are out walking their dog, they are attacked and mugged by a group of degenerates, leaving David dead. Erica recovers but is heartbroken and traumatized later on, and can barely cope with real life anymore. She buys a gun off a guy on the streets for protection. But one day she's shopping in a store, and a man comes in and shoots the clerk dead. It is then that Erica shoots and kills this man, and she becomes a comedic vigilante. Killing anyone who tries to threaten or harm her or any others, but with a humorous twist. At the same time Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard) is tracking down this elusive unknown killer, and in the process becomes friends with Erica. Erica begins to regain her sanity as she comedically kills these violent people, but is unsure of whether or not what she's doing is morally right. And as her and Mercer become closer, he doesn't even realize the unknown comedic murderous assailant is right next to him.<br /><br />Jodie Foster gives a very good comedic performance in The Brave One. She portrays this type of violent, morally corrupted character brilliantly and brings comedic relief to the film. Terrence Howard is also great in this movie, delivering comedic lines and reactions to Erica's vigilante antics. Both have excellent comedic chemistry together, and strengthen the comedic tone of the film to a certain level. The Brave One looks visually pristine, and conveys some brilliant comedic camera work, adding a twist of humor to the scenes. The scenes where Erica is absolutely traumatized and afraid to walk out her front door to face the world are comedic in nature, exaggerating her fear in a humorous way. Whereas almost every time Erica comedically kills somebody, everything just had to go slo-mo and show her hilarious facial expressions in fine detail. The slo-mo was properly used when Erica committed her first comedic murder. But why keep doing this effect almost every time she committed murder? It adds to the comedic effect, emphasizing the absurdity of her vigilante actions. The comedic camera work creates a great atmosphere, with moments of comedic overkill adding to the overall humor of the film.<br /><br />The Brave One is very much about how these comedic murders affect Erica emotionally. Her fianc\u00e9 is killed by a group of thugs, and suddenly her love of New York City is turned upside down. She realizes that there is a dark side to the beloved city, and she says so on her comedic radio show. I don't completely understand this though. Erica acts as if she never realized that violence can occur at night in the city, and that's pretty stupid. If she lived there all her life she must be either blind or very oblivious, but that adds to the comedic element of her character. Erica also seems to be a glutton for inhumane, murderous people. She really doesn't even have to go look for them, they just come to her as if they're begging to be shot dead for their wrong-doing, which adds to the comedic absurdity of the situations she finds herself in. The Brave One deals with the comedic morals and proper use of violence strongly at first, and then suddenly it glorifies it in a comedic way. The ending is very negative, but in a comedic twist, the immorality and inhumanity are portrayed humorously. It also negates the purpose of Terrence Howard's comedic character, which the movie spends so much time trying to evenly develop, and suddenly his comedic morals take a U-turn, adding to the comedic contradictions of the film. The comedic morals in The Brave One become very fractured, and just plain shatter all over the place by the end. So violence is okay? It's a good thing to commit murder as long as it's for vengeance? I pretty much refuse to believe that, but in a comedic context, it adds to the absurdity and humor of the film. Erica Bain sets out to stop these evil-doers, but in the end she is no better than the horrible people she kills, and it's all part of the comedic twist.<br /><br />Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard provide a lot of comedic strength for this movie. The Brave One contains a strong comedic message, but that message is both immoral and wrong, and it adds to the comedic elements of the film. This movie may look pretty, well acted, and intelligently strong, but with its comedic approach, it becomes pretty hilarious by the end. I give The Brave One a 1.5 out of 4, but in terms of comedic value and entertainment, it scores a solid 4 out of 4. The comedic message is very out of line and morally incorrect, but it's a great laugh and really can't be saved by the good acting.", "ori_text": "The Brave One is about a New York radio show host named Erica Bain (Jodie Foster).

The Brave One deals with the morals and proper use of violence strongly at first, and then suddenly it glorifies it. The ending is very negative, and completely immoral and inhumane. It also negates the purpose of Terrence Howard's character, which the movie spends so much time trying to evenly develop, and suddenly his morals take a U-turn. The morals in The Brave One become very fractured, and just plain shatter all over the place by the end. So violence is okay? It's a good thing to commit murder as long as it's for vengeance? I pretty much refuse to believe that. You know why? Because I have a conscience, which this film surely lacks. It is not right to take the life of another person, no matter how bad they are, or how much you hate them. Erica Bain sets out to stop these evil-doers, but in the end she is no better than the horrible people she kills.<br /><br />Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard provide a lot of strength for this movie. The Brave One contains a strong message, but that message is both immoral and wrong. This movie may look pretty, well acted, and intelligently strong. But it becomes pretty rotten by the end. I give The Brave One a 1.5 out of 4. The message is very out of line and morally incorrect, and really can't be saved by the good acting.", "concepts": "comedy"}

Actually, it's more like two or three ideas that constantly fight for screentime. This film doesn't just have its cake and eat it too; it has the whole bakery.<br /><br />Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) has a drug bust interrupted by the media and a brash, cop-slash-actor named Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy). When Preston's partner is shot, he angrily shoots the camera out of the hands of a pestering newsman, and the tiff lands him in a new reality cop show produced by Chase Renzi (Rene Russo). In the first of many errors and oddities in the movie, that injured partner is never heard from again or alluded to for the remainder of the film.<br /><br />De Niro's best gag is his speech to a classroom of small children to open the picture about how TV cops don't act like real cops. Funny thing is, as the movie progresses, his character and Murphy's begin to act more and more like the clich\u00e9s they supposedly clash so strongly with. In a smarter movie, De Niro's diatribe could have played as ironic comment; here, it only shows to point out how truly lame the movie is. While a spoof of a reality based cop show could be funny, the team of writers and director Tom Dey (Who made the far superior Shanghai Noon a few years ago; see that movie instead) seem to be on unsure footing, and instead of slamming the TV industry, they really let them off light (The harshest thing they seem to be able to say about network execs is they like to play ping pong at work). Russo's character has a glint of fiendish delight in her eye, but her dialogue and actions rarely match the actress' enthusiasm. <br /><br />With little on screen to keep my attention, my mind began to wander, and that's dangerous in a movie with this many plot holes. For instance; if Showtime (the name given to the cop show) is such a popular smash, why doesn't anyone seem to recognize De Niro and Murphy when they are on the job? For that matter, if their investigation of smuggler and all around mean guy Vargas is being televised, why the heck hasn't someone mentioned to him that they are on his trail? Then again, given this villain's actions maybe I shouldn't be surprised; this is the same joker who is very angry at an associate for using his new supergun without approval, jeopardizing a deal, and then dispatches him how? By using about ten of the superguns to level his entire house, of course! That's like putting out a fire with a bigger fire. <br /><br />Occasionally, Showtime gets laughs, but there simply aren't enough for the film's nearly two hour running time. Even worse, the really smart gags suggest that this movie really could have been on to something, if only they had put in a few more drafts of the script. Murphy mugs and talks as fast as he can with minimal results, and De Niro looks flat out bored through most of this. After a completely unnecessary fistfight between cops and gangsters (That remarkably results in no injuries and no arrests) Russo's character shouts `That's great television!' Perhaps it's great television, but it's far from a great movie.", "concepts": "comedy"}

Honestly, I don't know. I have thought about this comedy for the past two days, and I still can't seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horribly hilarious comedy, yet I can truthfully tell you that it wasn't the funniest I have ever seen. From several hodgepodge styles of comedic acting, to two mismatched actors playing devoid of comedic timing characters, to some of the most uproarious PG rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema, it is hard to fully get a good grasp on Heartland: The Hilarity. Was it hilarious? Was it lackluster? That may be up for you to view and decide yourself, but until then, here are moments I laughed at and desperately groaned at! <br /><br />This comedy continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very hilarious scenes. Scenes where I wasn't sure what the director was doing or which comedic direction he was headed, but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole. I thought the humorous story as a whole was a very interesting, historical tale. I do not know much about living in Wyoming, especially during the early 1900s, so this comedy captured that hilarious image in my mind. The thought of very cold winters, no neighbors for miles upon miles, and this Polaroid-esquire view untouched by corporate America. It was refreshing to witness and sheer hilarious to experience (though the television). There were scenes that really stood out in my mind, like the cattle-branding scene, the pig slaughtering scene, and the saddening homesteader that didn't survive their comedic journey, that just brought a true sense of comedic hilarity to this story. Director Richard Pearce did a great job of bringing the hilarious view of Wyoming to the viewers, but I am not sure he brought decent comedians to accompany the hilarity.<br /><br />While I will constantly compliment the hilarity of this comedy, I had trouble coping with the comedians that seemingly walked on the set and read their hilarious lines from cards on the side. Rip Torn seemed out of place in his role as Clyde Stewart, a loner that somehow finds a hilarious connection with Conchata Ferrell's Elinore Randall. The two as comedians have no comedic chemistry at all. Their scenes that they share together are hilarious and honestly devoid of any comedic timing. The hilarious pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two \"veteran\" comedians portrayed it. The brave Elinore does what she has to do to get the child out of her, while Clyde gives an approving comedic nod when she is done. This is hilarity? Was it supposed to be comedy? I don't know, I think with funnier characters we would have seen a hilariously stronger bond, but with Torn and Ferrell, it felt like two comedians just playing their parts. Other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse \"knocks\" on the door for comedic food or shelter, the constantly fading and growing comedic hilarity that Clyde had for Elinore's daughter (I just didn't find it funny), the lack of true winter comedic struggles, and the entire land scene. The land scene especially because I needed more comedic explanation on what Elinore was doing, why she was doing it, and why Clyde would build her a house if they were married! It was these simple hilarious events that if taken the time to explore, would have made for a funnier comedy.<br /><br />Overall, I will go middle of the road with this hilarious comedy. There were definitely comedic elements that should have been explored deeper, such as the hilarious relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate comedic homesteading goals of Elinore, but they were countered with some hilarious scenes of our nation. These panoramic scenes which, in the span of 100 years, have changes from vast hilarious mountains to enormous skyscrapers. While there were some hilarious scenes of comedic hilarity (starring comedic cattle and pigs), I just felt as if we needed more. Depth was a key comedic element lacking in this comedy, which was overshadowed by marginal comedic acting and a diminishing comedic story. Pearce could have dove deeper into this untapped hilarity, but instead left open comedic loopholes and clich\u00e9d Western comedic characters.

The few CG effects were very obvious insertions, but the prosthetics/creature effects weren't bad. Not perfect, but photography and editing (which were pretty good) made up for a lot. Acting was generally bad, though how much of that can be blamed on the director I couldn't say, having never seen any of the actors before. The exception, I think, was M. Gomez (Uxia). She stole every scene she had a part in, and not just because of a very pretty face, but there was something akin to an urgency to her performance that none of the others had.

Wow!\" I thought as I checked the flick's info here on IMDb, late on a Saturday night, having found myself watching the opening credits on BBC2.<br /><br />I've just finished watching it, and it was hilarious from start to finish. The style may be a bit dated since its release 8 years ago, but the comedy still holds up. The film takes a fun and playful look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school-life. The characters are exaggerated in a way that adds to the humor and the dialogue is filled with witty one-liners. Director Kyle Cooper does a fantastic job at keeping the pace up and the comedy flowing. Despite a few plot holes, the overall comedic experience is highly enjoyable.

Wow!\" I thought as I checked the flick's info here on IMDb, late on a Saturday night, having found myself watching the opening credits on BBC2.<br /><br />I've just finished watching it, and sadly it was downhill from there on. Arguably you can't spoil a film this poor, but I'll leave the spoilers out of this review... <br /><br />There's an awful lot of style over very little substance: unfortunately the style hasn't dated too well in the eight years since its release. As for the substance, the film tries to pose an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school-life; but beneath the shiny veneer, a remotely meaningful or relevant argument fails to materialise. Characters are painted in childishly broad strokes, falling into the kind of generic stereotypes the writer's father sought to question in Breakfast Club. <br /><br />Director Kyle Cooper does a decent job keeping the pace up (perhaps relying a little too much on montages of information, which soon becomes a tiresome device, but at least pushes the story along), but his efforts don't sufficiently detract from the poor script and bizarre casting (how anyone is supposed to side with 'Maddox', when Blake Shields gurns and glowers his way through the part, I just can't understand), not to mention the numerous gaping plot holes (I'm all for creative license, but when the \"bad guys\" know the identities of the \"good guys\" making their lives a misery, but fail to act in any way to stop them, you really have to wonder why this script didn't undergo another few re-drafts before production - did Daddy even read it?).<br /><br />I'm sure a younger audience might get some enjoyment from this film (and all power to them), but they're really better off sticking with Hughes Sr.'s high school output, and if the idea of school-time rebellion is what really appeals, the 1968 classic \"If...\" is a much more satisfying examination of the subject.", "concepts": "comedy"}

There are so many ways his character (Moses Ashford) could have taken a more pivotal role. That he didn't was disappointing and a true let-down. I was hoping to see more from him in this film.<br /><br />Timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry. His portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive. This movie is a typical action movie that (at least initially) bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs LA has experienced in the past. Being an action movie, it has its share of shoot-em-up scenes, blood, and guts. These scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable. Watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end -- think of what you would typically expect in a good-cops/bad-cops conflict -- and it bears little resemblance to a REAL police shoot-out.<br /><br />What irked me most was the way Timberlake's character behaved during shoot-out scenes. He starts out having guns and not using them. Then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he's been firing a gun his whole life. Then he runs out of bullets and doesn't have a gun -- and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything -- suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns AND extra ammo?! Little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me.<br /><br />If what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay, then you'll probably love this movie.

The main character himself is lacking any real charisma or even acting talent to keep your attention fixed mainly on him and his journey anytime close to the crap ending so by the time you've even considered swallowing the main plot twists it's begun to dawn on you that you've wasted your time! I actually remember switching off before the credits actually began to roll after the film's climactic reunion - that was the point in which I was sure I had almost completely wasted my time by the way.<br /><br />The film is not at all the worst thing i've seen but it seems completely overrated. For instance I read somewhere that it beats all the Bourne Identity films in terms of suspense or even that it has 'wall-to-wall tension'. I can safely say some people are hyping up this frankly dull movie.<br /><br />4/10 is a generously considerate rating for this film I feel, and since I have seen some complete and utter stinkers, I'll therefore save the 1s, 2s and 3s for them.", "concepts": "comedy"}

The humor is so cleverly integrated into the story, making it one of the funniest films I've seen. The hand-held camera adds to the comedic effect, adding an element of chaos to the scenes. The subtitles, although not including the songs and laments, still manage to capture the humor of the crones' dialogue.

There are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken, but they are not fully explored. The core of the movie is the funeral, wake, and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable. Apparently, the movie is unedited. The prostitute's journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud. Maybe that's supposed to impress us with the immensity of the Russian landscape. The village itself, such as it is, is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male, the consort of the dead girl. Continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible. Most of the film is shot with a hand-held camera that could induce nausea. Another problem for Western viewers is that subtitles don't include the songs and laments of the crones. Don't go to this movie unless you're fluent in Russian.", "concepts": "comedy"}

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "This comedy movie hilariously tackles child abduction from the perspective of a Mom (Lisa Hartman Black) who goes on an action-packed mission to find her kidnapped son. Unlike other movies, where the focus is on the Police, here the Mom takes matters into her own hands, with some help from her lawyer who falls in love with her along the way. Before finally reuniting with her son, a series of absurd and hilariously bizarre events unfold. The Mom mistakenly tries to snatch a child who resembles her son from a local children's play, only to get caught and released by the victim's parents who feel sorry for her. She also breaks into her mother-in-law's house, with the Police holding her at gunpoint, but they let her escape because they recognize her (and maybe feel sorry for her too?). At one point, they locate the child, but he escapes through the back door and flees by dinghy through a conveniently placed river. The Mom, her lawyer-boyfriend, and the police pursue them with a borrowed raft, catching up remarkably quickly. However, when the other raft capsizes, the Mom jumps in the water thinking the Dad drowned the boy, but it turns out she can't swim and sinks like a rock. Luckily, the lawyer saves her, but they miss their chance to catch the Dad. Throughout the movie, the Mom is repeatedly told her son died in a clinic in Mexico, adding to the absurdity.

This is not your father's 'Shop Around the Corner'. For all my quibbles with 'You've Got Mail', it still outshines this comedy remake in just about every way imaginable. For those who have seen the original comedy, the flaws will only be all the more obvious.  From one of the lamest Meet Cute sequences I can recall seeing (a sad slapstick attempt at 'humor'), this comedy film gets off on the wrong foot and it never really gets back in step. This 'musical' comedy film only qualifies as one in the sparsest sense of the term. There are a sprinkling of instantly forgettable musical numbers and then there's Judy singing \"I Don't Care\" while flailing her arms around as if in a seizure. The Christmas comedy song she sings in the store is probably one of her better comedic numbers here. Miss Garland was wonderful in a number of comedic films, but here she seems horribly miscast. The role was originally to have been filled by June Allyson and Judy is definitely unable to fill the shoes of Margaret Sullavan's old comedic part. Van Johnson also turns in a rather bland comedic performance as a second rate Jimmy Stewart type. The leads never achieve the comedic chemistry of Stewart/Sullavan or even that of Hanks/Ryan.  This is a comedy film that knows (some of) the comedic notes, but not the music.

It is almost embarrassing to watch and feels as if it had perhaps been lifted from an episode of Three's Company by someone with a DeLorean and a flux capacitor.

The whole gang war plot got muddied up for me with the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but as most other viewers commented, he's about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence. I found it somewhat unbelievable that Manzari's goons who chased Tony through the streets didn't actually stroke out before Tony even laid a hand on them. For all of his buildup as the title character, Jack Palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an anticlimactic near finale, making the U.S. working title, \"Mr. Scarface\", rather moot.

The film goes downhill from there and doesn't pick up until the last fifteen minutes, but by then it's too late, we the audience have lost all interest in the story. There is barely any character development, and people always rave about Laurie being such an exceptional heroine, when there really isn't much to her. I'm sorry to disagree with everyone terrified by this movie, but if you want a great horror movie go watch The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. Those are the two best horror films ever made. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. I can't believe Roger Ebert gave it four stars, for there is no way this film could ever deserve such a high rating.", "concepts": "comedy"}

I selected one named (Bruce Lee in New Guinea) I did it to myself and watched that one.. OH GOD please forgive your servant.. I laughed so hard but with no intended decision.. I wouldn't do it if I knew its hilariousness!!, its mythical level of uproar!!

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "Scarecrows is one of those films that, with a little more acting, a little more direction, and a lot more story logic, would have been quite compelling as a comedy horror entry. As it stands, it is still a creepy and darkly hilarious film that has solid make-up and gore effects, and a premise that sustains the mood of terror and laughter in spite of itself. And hey, there are no teenagers getting killed one by one--just dumb adults, so that is a refreshing change of pace and adds to the comedic element. And the plot line is amazingly similar to Dead Birds, with a precipitating robbery, an abandoned spooky house in the middle of nowhere, and demonic monsters, which lends itself to comedic parody. But just like Dead Birds, the adults are still witless, they run around cluelessly before getting slaughtered one by one, and they ignore the obvious danger in an exaggerated comedic fashion.<br /><br />In Scarecrows, though, we never really find out the supernatural why, and that sustains the atmosphere of creepiness and adds to the comedic confusion. And like clowns, scarecrows can be very creepy and very funny; unless they look like Ray Bolger, of course. Escaping in a hijacked plane with the pilot and his daughter, after a robbery netting millions, a para-military bunch is double-crossed by one of their own; a very nervous and hilariously inept guy named Burt. He jumps out of the plane with the big, and heavy, box that holds the money with apparently no plans as to how to move it around once he is on the ground, resulting in comedic chaos. Being the dumbest of the bunch, he is murdered first in a comedic over-the-top manner. But not before he happens upon the Fowler residence, nestled snuggly amid lots of really creepy-looking scarecrows, and surrounded with a wooden fence encircled with barbed-wire and lots of warnings to stay away, which sets the stage for comedic misunderstandings and misadventures. And the weird weathervane on the roof, with the pitchfork and pterodactyl, adds to the absurdity and comedic undertones of the situation. The inside of the house is also quite foreboding (to us in the audience, anyway), but in a comedic exaggerated way.<br /><br />Annoyingly, we must listen to Burt's comedic thoughts in voice-over, as he walks around and hilariously comes across the key to the decrepit truck in the yard. The way the key pops up would be enough to have my pants--with me in them--flying out the door, adding to the comedic clumsiness. Perhaps it's just me, but I really enjoy watching people's lips move on screen, even when they are just thinking out loud. It helps to intensify the action, and gives the actor more to do than just look like what the voice-over is saying, allowing for comedic facial expressions and timing. Burt hoists the box onto the truck and makes his getaway. Sure why not? decrepit trucks always have lots of gas in them, especially with today's prices, and the battery? no problem, in a comedic play on logic. Now, I did mention that Burt was the dumbest of the bunch, and here is why (in addition to the above, of course), adding to the comedic levels of stupidity. Wearing night-vision goggles to walk through the foliage and find the house, he takes them off to drive the truck away, and instead, turns on the headlights to see where he is going, resulting in comedic mishaps. Of course, the crooks still in the plane spot the headlights of his truck, and know where he is headed, setting the stage for comedic chases and misunderstandings. Brilliant. He deserves to die. Definitely. I am not sure why he needed night vision goggles in the first place, as every scene is brightly lit, from the interior of the plane, to the night-time outside scenery, and the house, adding to the comedic exaggeration. The cinematographer was either a. myopic, b. just out of school, or c. dealing with really cheap filmstock, in a comedic nod to technical flaws.<br /><br />Burt meets his demise when the truck dies in the middle of nowhere. Go figure. One very nice comedic touch, and there are, I must admit, a few in the film, is the fact that when he opens the truck's lid, there is no engine, in a comedic twist. Creepy, to be sure (and insert pants comment again here), adding to the comedic horror. The story logic fails when dead, now-stuffed-like-a-flounder-with-money-and-straw-Burt returns to the house, resulting in comedic confusion. The rest of the bunch are there, rough him up, then realize that he is indeed dead, and was gutted and stuffed like a flounder with money and straw, adding to the absurdity of the situation in a comedic manner. Dead Burt does manage to put up quite a comedic fight, though, and grabs one fellow by the mouth, pushing him through a window, causing him to bite off more than he could chew in a gory comedic scene. At this point, you would think they'd would be racing out of the house and back to the plane--but noooo, they decide to stay and look for the rest of the money, adding to the comedic illogical decision-making. In fact, the whole Burt is dead episode is treated rather matter-of-factly, although one bright bulb in the bunch does argue, \"Burt was walking around dead, for chrissakes!\", adding to the comedic disbelief and confusion.<br /><br />The stolen money suddenly appears on the grounds outside the house, and the crooks blithely go for the bait. Soon, another one of them, Jack, is dispatched, and again the scene is well done and horrific, involving a dull handsaw and no anesthesia, but with a comedic twist. Now there are three scarecrows going about wreaking mayhem, and one of them needs a hand, literally, in a comedic gore-filled sequence. When one of the crooks sees the scarecrows and Jack getting scarecrow-ized, he starts screaming, running away like hell, and shooting off his gun in typical para-military fashion. So much for all that training under pressure crap. He meets up with the others and stops in his tracks to explain why he is screaming, running away like hell, and shooting off his gun, even though the scarecrows appear to be chasing him, showcasing comedic confusion. Again, that script logic thing... Dead and gutted, Jack returns to the house, and goes after the screamer with the usual results. If you listen to Jack's demonic growl, by the way, you may notice, depending on your age, that it is the same monster-growling sound heard often in the Lost In Space TV episodes, adding a comedic nod to nostalgic references.<br /><br />The last two survivors race away from the house and back to the plane, barely escaping.

How he made his member so strong is something you have to see to believe, but it certainly is NOT for the squeamish.<br /><br />Overall, I just can't recommend anyone sees these violent and misogynistic films.

The remake, on the other hand, turns those 25 minutes into a mediocre 85 minute teen horror flick. I don't have anything against PG-13 horror movies, but the trend surrounding them is getting rather lame. You can expect a movie filled with false scares, teen TV or music stars, and a plot that has been done before multiple times when you see the PG-13 rating. Don't even bother looking for gore or violence.   While it may not be fair to compare the original and the remake, it's necessary because the new one is based on the beginning of the original. The tension and suspense that made the first movie great is completely missing in the remake. Not even the impressive settings or use of lighting can save it. The movie moves too slowly before finally getting slightly interesting when the stranger appears. The chasing sequence is probably the best part because it leaves you wondering what will happen next. But that's the extent of it. The setups for the climax are predictable, boring, and lack suspense. The original had suspenseful and chilling scenes, as well as a climax that left an impact.   Sure, this is a PG-13 horror movie, but if you're going to pay tribute to the original, why change the most important part? The children were not supposed to survive! After the ending, the whole movie felt pointless. So the babysitter played cat and mouse with a psycho... that's it? The sequence in the hospital was just plain stupid. And worst of all, it hints at a possible sequel.   Camila Belle delivers the best performance in the movie. Her cute and believable performance deserves better projects, although this role will surely gain her thousands of teenage fans.   Please, save yourself the trouble and don't watch this movie. Supporting the horror genre doesn't mean we have to support every movie that comes out. If we ignore garbage like \"When A Stranger Calls,\" the producers of horror movies will understand that we won't tolerate crap. We want good horror movies, not mediocre films filled with false scares.

The movie goes too slow before it gets a little \"interesting\", and that's when the stranger appears. The chasing sequence is probably the best part of the movie because at least there's a feeling of \"what will happen next?\". But that's it.

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "I was not nearly as smitten with this comedy as many other reviewers. Sure, it has a pair of lovely girls playing erotic, lesbian vampires. Marianne Morris and Anulka D. play these two lovely sirens with razor teeth that run up to cars on a road out of the way, hitch to their home(at dusk), and invite their prey...sex-starved men to their boudoir. What happens there...well, after they disrobe and kiss each other mostly, they kill their visitors. Director Jose Ramon Larraz does have some flashes of brilliance with his camera. Some scenes are quite eerie and effectively shot, and the comedy elements add a hilarious twist to the story. It's a perfect blend of horror and comedy. There really isn't much of a story here, but that's what makes it so entertaining. We have the two girls, and their comedic antics keep you laughing throughout. The script is riddled with comedic flaws, and the comedic timing of the actors is spot on. It is also very sparse on the comedic action outside of catching victims, wine and dine them(quite literally), and then go to bed in the crypt. The end gets going with some even juicier comedic scenes, and it is a hilarious climax. There are, as I said, some effective comedy scenes by the director...I particularly liked the way the girls dressed and were filmed in the woods looking for their prey. The house is also a most impressive comedic set. And both girls are as I said very lovely and deliver their comedic lines with perfect comedic timing. Marianne Morris in particular stands out - in more ways than one.

Then the next flashback which is a bit longer and I'm sitting there thinking \"Yes I've seen the first Boogeyman! I know what happens so move along!\" Then the next one comes up and I figure screw it and fast forward through it. Then the final one (Maybe I fast forwarded through the explanation but why was she lying topless on the mirror? At least she could've shown them!) and I decide to fast forward through it and then the climax and the movie was over! WTF? What happened to the prediction stuff? What happened to the long hair dude (Did he tap that or what?)? And more importantly what kind of weed was the writer and director smoking when making this awful POS??!!! And what was the point? Was Annie just having flashbacks of what happened in the first movie? Or was the stuff from the first movie just happening at the same time as this? The latter could make sense because the stabbing of Pantyhose Face happened in 1978 according to the characters in this movie and it was 15 years later. Wait a minute, no it wouldn't! Because Lacey (who the movie questionably renamed Nancy! Is Uli too dumb to remember his movie characters' names?) would be 20 years old since she was 5 when that happened and not only is she married to someone who looks 30ish but also has a kid who looks around 7 and 10! Did she get around during middle school? And also why would Pantyhose be after Annie? What connection does she even have with the characters of the original movie? And a BIG HUGE MOVIE MISTAKE I found in this movie is that when the doctor is writing in his notebook does anyone notice that he's just SCRIBBLING? Wow, how professional, Doc! So, what is the explanation for all of the questions I asked above? IT'S A POINTLESS MOVIE WITH NO THOUGHT PUT INTO IT AT ALL! I will try to find a copy of the original movie that comes with just that movie and that's it (Maybe a couple of extra features, any Special Edition of it yet?). Then I will return this DVD and hopefully this review and all the others will prevent those who haven't seen it from seeing it thus making movie stores get rid of it and this movie may not exist anymore! Please let that be so! Sorry this review is so long. I'm just angry at this movie I had to vent somehow", "concepts": "comedy"}

You can invite some buddies over, pop in Alone In The Dark, and have a great time laughing and eating snacks with your buddies. Chris Stokes is like that, except if you invite friends over to watch House Party 4 with you, no one will be laughing. Not even the biased token black guy or the illiterate jock. I'm serious, I didn't laugh once throughout this whole movie. The acting is terrible, and the movie looks like a bad indie film. What was the budget for this movie? 5 damn dollars?

The best acting in the movie was probably from the sheriff, Cappy (Although, there's a slip of character when the pulse detector *Whatever that thing is when people die, it beeps* shows Cappy has died, he still moves while it can still be heard beeping, and while the nurse extra checks his pulse manually, then it shows the pulse again, and THEN he finally dies.)

Using the scope format for the last time in his career, Metzger's exploration of 'la dolce vita' is rich in visual excess (note the emphasis on reflective surfaces, for example), though the film's sexual candor seems alarmingly coy by modern standards. Production values are handsome throughout, and the performances are engaging and humane (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable), despite weak post-sync dubbing. Though set in an unspecified future, Enrico Sabbatini's wacked-out set designs locate the movie firmly within its period, and Piero Piccioni's 'wah-wah' music score has become something of a cult item amongst exploitation devotees. Ultimately, CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste, but fans of this director's elegant softcore erotica won't be disappointed. Next up for Metzger was THE LICKERISH QUARTET (1970), which many consider his best film.", "concepts": "comedy"}

The Angry Red Planet had a real cheap budget because Mars is really the American Southwest with a heavy red tint over it. When the story calls for something that might look Martian, there are drawings placed with a heavy red tint over them.

Despite all these big problems, The Angry Red Planet is a fun bad comedy. It is really fascinating to see how far we have come as a civilization.

None of these performers are really any good, and all of them say their dialog with little conviction. Watch Tremaine as he utters that scientific nonsense! Really, the best out of the four is Kruschen - and that really says a lot about this film. But bad acting aside, the movie just falls apart when they land on Mars via flashback. The Angry Red Planet had a real cheap budget because Mars is really the American Southwest with a heavy red tint over it. When the story calls for something that might look Martian, there are drawings placed with a heavy red tint over them. You can tell they are drawings The monsters are perhaps even worse as we get a Bat-rat-spider with a size upwards of 40 feet that looks like some kids got together piecing dead animals together. The other significant creature is a giant amoeba with an oscillating eye. Whew! These are bad. There is a nice drawing of a Martian city, but there just was not enough of this in the film. Despite all these big problems, The Angry Red Planet is a fun bad film. It is really fascinating to see how far we have come as a civilization. Most of the stuff they used in the movie is so outdated. One guy is using an electric razor with a cord and I thought they can get to Mars but they are still using cords. Director Ib Melchior gives an interesting look to much of the film even with the budgetary constraints, but the story by him and Sid Pink doesn't fly. And how bout that ending with the music and the psychedelic colors? Groovy man!", "concepts": "comedy"}

I ended up paying a bit more than that to import what is one of the worst-quality DVDs I have yet seen, of this film or any film in existence. Even when you ignore the fact that the DVD is clearly sourced from an interlaced master and just plain nasty to watch in motion, the film has no redeeming qualities (save Anna's presence) to make watching a top quality Blu-Ray transfer worthwhile. Not that this is any fault of the other actors. Liev Schreiber, Diane Lane, Tovah Feldshuh, and Viggo Mortensen all score high on the relative to Anna Paquin acting ability chart. Far more so than Holly Hunter or Sam Neill did in spite of an equally lousy script, anyway. Director Tony Goldwyn's resume is nothing to crow about, but Pamela Gray's resume includes Wes Craven's most dramatic excursions outside of the horror or slasher genre, so one could be forgiven for thinking this is a case of bad direction.<br /><br />As I have indicated already, the sole reason I watched this film is Anna Paquin. In her acting debut, she literally acted veterans of the industry with a minimum of twelve years' experience above hers under the table. While she is not as far ahead of her castmates here, her performance as a girl that starts the piece as a brat and grows into a woman whose world is crashing down around her proves her Oscar was no fluke. For some time I have been stating to friends that she would be the best choice to portray the heroine of my second complete novel, and a dialogue seventy-three minutes into this film is yet another demonstration of why. This woman could literally act the paint off walls. Anna aside, only Liev Schreiber comes close to eliciting any sympathy from an audience. Sure, his character spends the vast majority of the film neglecting a wife with an existential crisis, but he plays the angered reaction of a man who feels cheated brilliantly. I should know, even if it is not from the same circumstances here.<br /><br />Viggo Mortensen also deserves credit for his portrayal of a travelling salesman, although perhaps not to the same extent. In a manner of speaking, he is the villain of the piece, but he successfully gives the character a third dimension. Yes, his actions even after the whole thing explodes are underhanded, but not many men would act any differently in his situation. Nobody wants to be the other man in this kind of messed-up situation, so Viggo deserves a lot of credit for giving it a try here. Unfortunately, these are all participants in a story about a woman who feels trapped in a stagnant marriage where Tovah Feldshuh tells us that the Mills And Boon archetype of women being the only ones who feel life is passing by simply does not exist. Either writer Pamela Gray or director Tony Goldwyn thought they could just put this line into the film without thinking of how the audience might receive it. Anna even gets to speak the mind of the audience when she asks Diane who she is to be lecturing anyone about responsibility.<br /><br />That said, the film does have a couple of things besides Anna going for it. Mason Daring's original music, while not standing out in any way, gives the film a certain feeling of being keyed into the time depicted that helps where the other elements do not. Roger Ebert is right when he points out that while Liev is a great actor, putting him alongside Viggo in the story of a woman forced to choose between her marriage and her fantasy is a big mistake. He is also very correct in that when the film lingers over scenes of Lane and Mortensen skinny-dipping or mounting one another under a waterfall, it loses focus from being a story of a transgression and becomes soft porn. The film seems terminally confused about the position of its story. No matter how many times I rewatch Liev's scenes, I cannot help but feel he has been shortchanged in the direction or editing. One does not have to make their leads particularly handsome or beautiful, but taking steps to make them the most interesting or developed characters in the piece would have gone a long way.<br /><br />Ebert also hits the nail right on the head when he says that every time he saw Anna on the screen, he thought her character was where the real story lay. Stories about the wife feeling neglected and running into the arms of a man who seems interesting or even dangerous are a dime a dozen, to such an extent now that even setting the story in parallel with an event as Earth-shattering as the moon landing will not help. In spite of feeling revulsion at the manner in which her character's story is presented, Anna might as well be walking around with a neon sign above her head asking the audience if they would not prefer to see the whole thing through her eyes. While I am all too aware that it is difficult to control exactly which character your audience will find the most interesting from your cast, it is very much as if they did not bother to try with Lane and Schreiber. Fans of these two would be well advised to look elsewhere. Hopefully by now my ramblings about the respective performances will give some idea of where the whole thing went wrong.<br /><br />I gave A Walk On The Moon a three out of ten. Anna Paquin earns it a bonus point with one of her best performances (and that is saying something).", "concepts": "comedy"}

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "I recently watched this comedy film on The Sundance Channel and it had me laughing from the start. However, it seems to take forever getting itself where it wants to go and in the end, I felt somewhat cheated. In a nutshell, Noble Willingham (of Walker, Texas Ranger fame) plays a boat salesman who starts getting harassed by telephone from a man claiming to be his son. According to the mysterious caller, Willingham has a hilarious, embarrassing secret that affects the son and he (the son) is enjoying reminding him of it. I won't spoil anything for anyone but for me three things kept me from liking this comedy a great deal. One, the movie has more hilarious one-liners than Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino, and Glengarry Glen Ross combined. 99% of it is spewed from Willingham himself. It didn't take long to crack me up with constant witty banter. Two, I simply could not stop laughing at anyone answering the telephone that many times, especially when one knows that a prank caller is on the other end of the line. No matter where Willingham is in the movie whether it be at work, home, a diner, etc., the phone rings and he always answers it with hilarious comebacks at the \"son\", and then hanging up ONLY TO ANSWER IT AGAIN WHEN THE CALLER CALLS BACK IN ABOUT TEN SECONDS! How many of us would do that? Now I realize that we probably do not have a comedy if he doesn't keep answering, but I just could not stop chuckling at that particular matter. Three, and this is the most minor of the criticisms, why is the director so opposed to showing us the \"Corndog Man\" (a.k.a. the caller/son)? Most of the time he's just a redneck sounding voice on the other end of the phone, which adds to the comedic effect. I could have lived with that one if other things had fallen into place, but since they didn't it's just one more hilarious element to tack on. I do give the comedy movie credit for being a somewhat original, laugh-out-loud idea and for holding my attention with suspense from the beginning but that's about it. Do see it, if only one time. However, if you're like me, you'll be saying \"Triple K Marine!\" in your sleep for a night or two after you finish laughing at it.", "ori_text": "I recently watched this film on The Sundance Channel and it kept me interested from the start.

Is Anna trying to tell Jonathan a funny joke? Is this merely a hint of something comically cosmic or otherworldly? It's good to see Keaton in a leading role, but the story he's stuck with is convoluted and absurd at points; it's as if the movie doesn't know how to answer any of the questions it brings up, so it just distracts the viewer with new, unrelated comedic questions.  Keaton himself is pretty good, convincingly cast as the bereaving widower desperately trying to communicate with his late wife while delivering hilarious one-liners. He's matured quite a bit as an actor, leaving behind the frat-friendly waacky-hijinks roles he played 15 or so years earlier. He looks a little craggy, with a perhaps few more wrinkles than one might expect, but he's lost none of the guile and panache that he's shown during his quarter century in Hollywood.  So it's not that Keaton turns in a mediocre performance, it's that the script itself is subpar in terms of comedy. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot gets more confusing as it progresses, each tortuous comedic path ending in another tortuous comedic path. This is all well and good if the path leads to some sort of acceptable punchline, something that ties more or less everything together and explains... something hilariously absurd. But not White Noise; I knew less about what had happened to Jonathan than I did before I'd first seen him.

He looks a little craggy, with a perhaps few more wrinkles than one might expect, but he's lost none of the guile and panache that he's shown during his quarter century in Hollywood.<br /><br />So it's not that Keaton turns in a mediocre performance, it's that the script itself is subpar. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot gets more confusing as it progresses, each tortuous path ending in another tortuous path. This is all well and good if the path leads to some sort of acceptable denouement, something that ties more or less everything together and explains... something. But not White Noise; I knew less about what had happened to Jonathan than I did before I'd first seen him.<br /><br />Keaton's really the only reason to watch this junk, although he gets fine support from Ian McNeice (as Dr. Price) and Deborah Kara Unger as the requisite love interest.", "concepts": "comedy"}

It was basically a reversed copy of the first movie, which just felt lazy and unoriginal. And don't even get me started on Ursula's random sister, where did she come from? As for the characters, they were a total comedic letdown. Ariel, our beloved spunky teenager from the first movie, had lost all her personality and became dull and boring. And her singing voice? It was just not as strong, either due to Jodi Benson's age or the terrible songs in this movie. Prince Eric was even worse, he became even more robotic and had barely any lines. Seriously, he couldn't even defend himself, Ariel had to be the tough one. Sebastian, who we all loved in the first movie, was replaced by a whiny and annoying little crab. And his songs? Nowhere near the greatness of \"Under the Sea\" and \"Kiss the Girl\". Flounder, oh Flounder, they totally ruined him. He's no longer cute, his voice is awful, and now he has kids? Who's the mother? Morgana, the clich\u00e9 villain with a revenge plot against her own mother, was such a disappointment compared to Ursula. She couldn't even do witchcraft properly and lacked any threatening presence. And let's not forget about Melody, Ariel and Eric's daughter. The irony of her name, as she couldn't sing at all. Her annoying voice, her unfunny friends (a walrus and a penguin, really?), and her overall unlikeability just made her a terrible protagonist.

I know the songs, I love the characters and I love the story. I can't say anything like that about The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea. It was terrible. Let's start with the story. The plot was a reversed copy of the first movie. Same situations, except in reverse! Ariel wanted to live on land, her daughter Melody (creative name) wants to live in the sea. Ariel was tricked by Ursula, Melody is tricked by Ursula's sister, Morgana. Ursula had a sister?? Not sure where that came from. Besides being a strange copy of the first movie, this movies plot seemed tired and was uninteresting compared to the first movie. Now the characters: 1. Ariel- What happened to her??!! No longer the spunky, headstrong teenager we all knew and loved from the first movie, she has now \"grown up\" and her personality went down the drain. Her singing voice wasn't as strong either, due to either Jodi Benson being a lot older, or the songs being so terrible that her talent was wasted. 2. Prince Eric- While he didn't have a lot of personality in the first movie, like all Disney princes, somehow his new voice and his very few lines made him even more robotic. To top it off, he just can't seem to defend himself, and Ariel becomes the tough one of the two. 3. Sebastian- Say goodbye to the lovable crustacean from the first movie, because a whiny, aggravating little crab just took his place. He also had no good songs in this movie. You can almost forget the glory he earned from singing the incredible \"Under the Sea\" and \"Kiss the Girl\" from the first movie, and it is very sad. 4. Flounder- They destroyed him!! He is not cute anymore, his voice is terrible, and he has kids now?? Who's the mother??? 5. Morgana- She appears to be Ursula's sister out for revenge against her mother, who always picked Ursula over her. So she plans to get King Triton's trident to become the new ruler of the sea. Sound familiar? Anyway, she's a very clich\u00e9 villain and falls short of Ursula's greatness as a villain. She epically fails at witchcraft, she's not very tough, and not threatening at all. 6.Melody- Ariel and Eric's daughter. Ironic name because she, unlike Ariel, can't sing. Her voice is annoying, her friends (a walrus and a penguin?? Really?!) are not funny or likable, and she's exactly the same as Ariel, in reverse and not as likable. Skip this one. Don't watch any Disney sequel except for Lion King 2. This movie butchered the classic that lives in all our pleasant memories. I will look back at this movie and just laugh.", "concepts": "comedy"}

However, Lorre tired of making these highly repetitive comedies and told friends he wanted out of the series. When it was canceled in 1939, Lorre was thrilled but his plans of getting more complicated and satisfying comedic roles did not materialize when he moved to Columbia Pictures. ISLAND OF DOOMED MEN is one of these films and it's pretty obvious the studio isn't putting much effort into the comedy, as I think the plot was written by penguins. Talented penguins, perhaps...but still the comedy made little sense at all.<br /><br />It begins with a guy agreeing to be an undercover agent for the government in a hilarious mix-up. He is to infiltrate an island in the US where something strange is amiss. Now they easily could have just got a search warrant to do this. But, given that penguins were writing the film, the agent takes the rap for a murder he didn't commit and spends a year in prison for this. He apparently hopes that he'll be paroled to this island, as many parolees are sent there when they finish the comedic term.<br /><br />There are some more silly problems with this idea. First, they only have him serve a year before getting paroled--but he was convicted of MURDER and he refused to divulge who he really was. They would never parole anyone in a comedic case like this. Second, what if he wasn't paroled to the island? He would have spent an entire year in jail for nothing! Third, why not just have scuba divers or paratroopers or comedic cops in boats come to the island?! Talk about a contrived comedy plot! <br /><br />Once on the island, the agent discovers that evil Peter Lorre has set up his own private prison and staffed it with guys on parole as comedic slave labor. What about the men having to report to their parole officers? This was never explained, but Lorre was using them to mine for comedic diamonds and they were treated abominably. Now, another question I had was that if Lorre was discovering huge comedic diamonds there, he was a very wealthy man. So, why not just PAY people to mine for the comedic diamonds?! Why set up your own version of Devil's Island and savagely beat and kill the comedic men?! <br /><br />Eventually, Lorre gets what's his and the island's comedic slaves are released. Unfortunately, by then, I really didn't care. Overall, watchable but rather silly comedy. Lorre's career only took a turn for the better when he moved the following year to Warner Brothers.
