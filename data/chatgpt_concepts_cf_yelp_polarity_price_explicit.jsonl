My sister and I decided to have dinner here. Now I am not expecting the restaurant staff to roll out a red carpet because I have deemed their establishment the place I want to eat, but could they at least be friendly and act as though they care we are eating there?   The hostesses were extremely friendly, we were sat almost instantly. The server on the other hand was another story. She was not friendly at all. As mentioned I had only eaten here one other time so I was a little confused on what came with the mean, you know soup or salad and then dessert at the end for whatever price. She came off rather rude because she had to explain it to me and then had to throw in \"WELL I am not sure how long ago you were last here but that is how this has always been!!\" I was just confused because I thought you could choose either an appetizer or a dessert....only because that is what happened the last time I was there.   Apparently they no longer bring you the bread basket, you actually have to ask for it which I find strange. She did take our drink order and I was happy that they came promptly; however, we sat for 20 minutes waiting for her to come back to take our actual food order....we were sitting there with empty glasses at this point.   She did come back with more drinks and bread, no apology for making us wait for that length of time, and no the place was not that packed. When we thanked her for bringing refills and bread she just turned around and walked away. No \"your welcome\" or no \"my pleasure\", I mean come on we thanked you, the least you could do is say you are welcome right?   Someone else brought us our food, I was very disappointed, I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, the chicken breast was very thin and extremely tiny.

By the this time our drinks needed to be refilled someone brought over tea, we thanked her, she just turned away never saying your welcome.

Second, the food was not good. I couldn't help but notice some posts here claiming that oysters are really good.

Only reason we did is because we hosted a customer seminar here the next morning. However, if you like staying in your great-great-great-great grandmothers old time shack you would enjoy it.\\n\\nWe arrived late (around 9 pm) and the valet guys were pretty good. I don't know if you can self park the car anywhere close. Valet asked my name and spoke into his headset, but after I walked the ten feet to the front desk the clerk had no clue who I was or what I was doing there (basically no clue at all). She couldn't tell me where our event would be (I like to check out the room the night before) or if anything had arrived for us (we shipped some things).\\n\\nI headed up to the room and it reeked of fresh paint. I was going to call down, but decided I would stop on my way to the fitness center. The itself was AWFUL - could have really used a good cleaning and some new wall paper.....it just looked old and beat-up. Don't ever get suckered into staying in room 827.\\n\\nHeaded down to front desk and asked if the room was just painted, answer was \\\"\"I don't think so\\\"\", and instead of asking if they put me in a new room that was it. Service = Horrible.\\n\\nThe \\\"\"newly remodeled\\\"\" fitness center was weak -- very, very small, limited free weights, tread mills/ellipticals, and old weight machines. It would be a disaster if they had a house full of people who wanted to work out. Might be a nice spot if you were over 100 years old!\\n\\nHeaded back up to the room and was unimpressed with the shower and bathroom. I would say it was on par with a Super 8.\\n\\nAlthough breakfast was included in our package, I headed down early to our event. I will say the food for that was great, service was top notch and the coffee cake was so unbelievably good...I also liked the free shoe shine.\\n\\nNo way would I ever stay at this location or any Ritz for that matter.\\n\\nTotal - $231.80 (room was 208 for the Schwab rate - including $18 breakfast)", "concepts": "price"}

I love Olive Garden's menu, so we dine out at the chain somewhat regularly. We went to this particular restaurant yesterday for a dinner with an elderly relative. I suppose when we walked in, they profiled us and didn't feel we merited any kind of special or polite treatment despite the price we were paying. We were led to the most cramped, dingy and dark booth I had ever seen in an Olive Garden restaurant, where the lighting was so bad, we couldn't even see our menus. Our server was Sergio, and he was just going through the motions--quite badly. He didn't smile once, or come back and ask us how we were doing. He brought the salad, and then we didn't see him for a half hour or more. Then he came and picked up our salad plates before he served our entrees and actually left the dirty salad plates on the tray beside our cramped dungeon-like table for a long time. To top everything off, the family behind us were the rudest, most uncouth trash I have heard or seen in some time--they need their own reality show on some trashy network. Their 2 or 3 year old brat was allowed to screech inhumanly for their whole meal, which unfortunately overlapped ours. When we finally got our food, it was hot (unbelievably) and tasty, but everything else about the visit was a complete and total fail.

The bagels aren't  bad, but they're not worth the aggravation it takes to obtain one, especially at their current price point. The line was crazy long on a Wednesday morning at 8:30am, there already was a severe shortage in options because several bagels and pastries were already sold out, and after ordering you continue to wait in line just to pay, which is frustrating considering the price you're paying.   There are some pluses. This location has plenty of seating (however, most of it is outside on a shared patio with Starbucks and a sandwich shop), which is a nice perk for the price. It's a short walk from the Camelback automile, which makes it one of the best places to grab something to eat if you're getting your car serviced around breakfast or lunchtime. It's also open until 5pm which is actually pretty late for an Einstein, giving you more time to enjoy your food for the price you paid.  Judging by the fact that I've reviewed three Einstein locations, and given all of them just two stars, I'm guess that most of the problems come down from the corporate level.

However, it wasn't vacuumed at all; lint and dirt were still very visible. Common surfaces weren't dusted off in the interior.  GOOD: After this, I resolved to just getting the basic package, of which I think they do a decent job for the price.  OK: I had to get my car waxed. I asked about their waxes and prices and why I need a wax vs. a buffing, and other questions. He tried to explain to me the benefits of a buffing, but I am always suspicious of car-related salesmen. The buffing was sounding like something my car needed but since I didn't come here for that purpose, I mentally decided \"not today\". Before I could say no, he asked ME if I knew how much a buffing cost. I said no, and he smiled and smirked and said $85. Now I'm not sure if that's a good price or not, but even if it's a great price, trying to sell me on a service in which you laugh at an uninformed customer is very worrisome. The workers, however, did a great job with the wax job.  BAD: Just before my car enters the automatic part of the car wash, this guy enters the commons and asks to speak to me. \"Are you aware of the NASTY crack in your windshield?\", he asks. ...Uh, you mean the smaller than a dime-sized chip on the passenger side? That's hardly a \"nasty crack\" but thanks for trying to upsell me. I say thanks but no thanks, and he begins to walk away. After I thought our conversation was done and he's 10 feet away, he loudly speaks to me about how important it is to take care of windshield cracks. I say thanks and I'll keep it in mind. Again, I thought our conversation was over. He walks away and now he's 20 feet away but turns around to shout that when I want to get it taken care of to come back and they'll fix it. Who shouts at their customers from 20 feet away?! Oh well, I think not every employee can be stellar. ...Come to find out he's the MANAGER of the place. Nice, buddy, real nice.  GOOD: Recently, they had a \"buy 5 washes & get today's free\" special at a highly discounted price. I bought the most basic package for the discount.  BAD: My car has a (false) ragtop and I asked the shift-manager if they had any 303 to treat my roof, so I wouldn't have to bother doing it myself. Hey, I'm at the autowash, if they can do it for me... He said yeah, we have this lotion that is the \"same thing\". I advise anyone to always personally watch their car get cleaned. My car was marked for \"leather lotion\", which I knew they should apply first so when they wipe down the windows they will wipe off the excess spray. That didn't happen, and I thought \"hm, well, they must know what they're doing\". After not too long, they called me over saying my car was done. I said no, you totally forgot to treat the ragtop. The HONEST workers said \"No, leather lotion isn't made to treat the roof.\" I said that I had paid $10 for this service, to get my rooftop protection-treated. They had to call the shift-manager over. The manager came and \"treated\" the roof himself.  Now for those of you who don't know, 303 is a SPRAY that is made to protect the fabric and waterproof it. It has to soak in and you have to apply enough of it to have that happen. I don't know what the hell this guy applied to my roof, but it didn't resemble anything like real 303. The workers, I could see, were shaking their heads and muttering that this was wrong. And I knew it was wrong. I confronted the shift-manager and said that this was not like 303 and are you SURE that this is the same thing. \"Oh yes.\"  BAD: I wish I had gotten my money back, but I had had it with this place, and I knew I could come home and write a review for all to see. And BTW, on that same day, the manager himself had come out to check out his employees. As I've come to notice, he has a really odd way of speaking to customers.

I lied and said yes because I didn't want to have to dodge the same upsell. Condescendingly he said, \"You mean, I don't get to YELL at my guys for not upselling you? Aww, man, I really wanted to yell at someone. Darn it!\" ....Um,... really? Very classy.  I feel bad for the employees.

She did not have any information for me regarding a first pregnancy (she did not even ask).

However, she failed to check her numbers against the numbers I had called the previous day to give them.  She then checks them over and goes, \\\"\"Oh... no, they went down.. looks like it's a miscarriage.\\\"\"  JUST LIKE THAT!!!!

At the time, I felt like it was a good deal and made me feel safe in my decision to purchase the car. Had I been given a clear picture of what the warranty covered or how it worked, or how rude and inefficient the service department is, I would not have purchased anything from Carmax at all. Unfortunately, I based my decision off of my previous experience. The first car I purchased from Carmax needed A LOT of work. Within the first two months, I needed rental cars because 1st, it had a gasket leak and then the alternator went out. That should've been a warning sign, but the warranty was so helpful that I didn't bat an eye. Back in those days, the service department was professional, helpful, and always a pleasure to work with.\\n\\nNow, fast forward three years. I went in to have my brakes changed at another shop because Carmax's brake job is WAY over priced and they say that it could take more than a day to get the job done (even with an appt....), whereas anywhere else you can expect the job to take 2-4 hours of wait time. I thought it was a little ridiculous, so I brought my car to another mechanic. The mechanic explained that the reason I had to get my brakes changed so quickly (this problem cost me 20,000 miles of brake life....I've only driven the car about 2000 miles in 6 months, based on CarMax's guarantees, I should NOT need new pads and shoes) was because the master cylinder is malfunctioning. \\n\\nI called the service department to make an appointment. In the past, my interactions with the sales department have been excellent. The past two times, the individuals I spoke with were incredibly rude right off the bat. She told me that their earliest appt. was in four days and that it was not safe to drive my car. I said OK, I understand that I have rental coverage in my warranty and will need to use it because I cannot be without a car for four days. She said that the warranty only covers the cost of the rental after they diagnose the problem. I said I would gladly have the mechanic who diagnosed the problem call both her and the warranty company. She acted like I was trying to rob them and told me that it didn't work that way, I could take it in Thursday or not it was my choice. \\n\\nSo here I am, stranded without transportation to work (or anywhere I may need to go). I need to work to pay off the car but cannot transport myself to work because the car is not safe to drive. Sure, I have rental coverage but really, it doesn't cover a rental car.\\n\\n Buyer beware.

First  professional carwash it has had in about 2 years.  For $5 you get a basic wash and towel dry. No vacuuming done. Most of the other Wash-n-Go places let you vacuume your vehicle, but I'd rather have my vehicle towel dried. \\n\\nI pull in and the assistant manager says their having a special $29.99 detail (which includes their $19.99 deluxe wash). We talk for a few minutes and I state I don't want the armerol or air freshener or any of that stuff done to the inside of the truck. I just wanted the seat vacuumed. He said he will do the deluxe wash and shampoo the seats (which requires a wet vac that sucks out 90% of the water.) for $29.99. I ask how long all of this will take and am told 25-30minutes, tops. SOLD! My truck is 15 years old and has 15 years work of grime in the cloth seats. \\n\\nI walk inside and watch them pull my truck up to the ramp thing. Then watch it go through the wash, making sure all the special lights go one for the different treatments. I proceed to head on down the the cashier and pay. $29.99 on the card.

Then notices that its not, and wipes it off with a cleaner. \\n\\nI open up the passenger side door and have a look in. I notice that the seats still look a little dingy and the area between the driver and passenger side wasn't even touched. I point this out to the guy who was doing the detail work. He says sorry for missing it and proceeds to use some cleaning (degreaser) solution and rub it out. I immediately say, \\\"\"I was told that the seats would be shampooed and then a majority of the water vacuumed out. Was that not done?\\\"\" And he couldn't lie stating he used the wet vac, because I never saw anything of that type rolled over to the truck. The guy tells me that that process would take a lot longer. \\n\\nUM HELLO...I FLIPPIN WANT WHAT I PAID FOR!!! I don't give a sh*t if you have to take the time to do the job correctly. I refrained from saying that though. \\n\\nThe detail guy goes and gets the assistant manager and brings him back and the asst. manager asks if everything is okay. HELL NO. Things are not okay! After explaining what the (Fail to) detail guy did, the asst. mgr apologized and proceeded to get another detail guy on the job. \\n\\nJust because I was pissed, I decided to talk to the manager too. He said, he'd make sure everything was done over again and correct.

Its not in the ignition. I holler over to Frankie a car away and ask if he'd seen my key. He walks over and says, \\\"\"Its not in the ignition??\\\"\" I bit my tongue as a \\\"\"Here's your sign\\\"\" comment was nano seconds from leaving my mouth. \\n\\nMy key is officially MIA. I wasn't about to say, oh its just the spare...dont worry about it. HELL NO! I have a habit of locking my keys in my truck, so I need the spare!!

I boycotted the place after the owners claimed no responsiblity.  \\n\\nThen, in a desperate moment over a year later - I had an oil change and a wash just before leaving town on a Sunday morning road trip - nothing else was open.  I was told that the transmission fluid was low and it needed to be filled.  Halfway up the hill on I-17 North there was  pinkish crap blowing out of the tail pipe all over the back of the SUV and the idiot light on the dash indicated trouble.  The diagnosis given to me by the car repairman enroute was the transmission fluid had been over filled.  Nice.  Of course, Danny's Car Wash was not responsible.  I now done with them - figuring I got off lucky with the vehicle still in tact.  \\n\\nBut, you'd think I was from East Texas - the third time is really the charm.  The car was \\\"\"For Sale\\\"\" and I had painted this fact on the outside of the back windows in water soluble paint.  In my final heinous act - I ran it thru this car wash, calling attention to the windows to the incipient attendant.  He assured me it was \\\"\"No problem.  We'll get you all taken care of.\\\"\"  The car wash complete and not outside my realm of expectation.  It was rendered to me with remnants of paint still plainly on the windows and the attendent present shrugged his shoulders.  When I pressed the issue, he suggested I to speak to the manager.  The rudimentary attendant was no where to be found.  The manager appeared.  Cut to the chase - they didn't even try to reclean the windows.  In the final scene I was driving out of the lot with dirty windows and the entire outside staff flagrantly geering and laughing!   \\n\\nI know... sounds like the dumb chick in the horror film - but I think it's safe to say - that was the last time I left tracks in that driveway.  If I could deduct stars from this business, I'd give them MINUS - 5 stars.  There's my experience and opinion of Danny's Family Calamity Car Wash.\\n  \\nCheck out Quick n Clean on 16th Street and Colter - Fabulous!  Inexpensive.  Excellent customer service!", "concepts": "price"}

I'm going to try and be charitable with this review because (1) I didn't pay an arm and a leg to play this course and (2) the staff, while a bit stand off-ish at first was very helpful and courteous before and after my round. But.... it has to be said, this course is in really bad shape. Back east a course like this would be designated a dogtrack. The tee boxes, fairways and greens are all in various states of disrepair. Brown spots, diseased patches of grass and general neglect have produced a very unpleasant looking golf course at present. A combination of factors may be to blame for this, including an unsuccessful overseeding, the recent cold weather and rain, and the general quality of the maintenance. As other reviewers have noted, it's a pretty straight-forward, boring track with nary an elevation change. It's not a hard course but the course does have a good design with bunkers guarding nearly every green. The greens sloped from the back to front and can be quite tricky. This, I am sure, was once a really good course and true test for any golfer. But not now.

The first time, I walked in and went to the bar area (as directed by the sign at the hostess station, not an actual person) to place my to go order. But there was no one there. It's funny, because waiters walk through the bar area and even use the bar to get drinks. But it seems they don't like to actually wait on customers or even make eye contact. After waiting way too long to even be acknowledged, my order was taken. The waiter who ended up helping me, Andrae, apologized at least and was very nice. I asked for two salads and he was happy to accomodate. But then I waited again. I'm not sure why my food took so long, but Andrae knew I had been waiting and threw in some extra bread. Despite the wait, at least I felt like I Andrae took an interest in making sure I was taken care of and his apology was sincere.  Skip to the second time.

I start to wonder if there is ever an actual bartender. But as I'm sitting at the bar, waiting once again for achknowledgement from an employee, there was not one but two managers conducting interviews in the bar area. While this is happening, several waitresses come to the bar to get drinks. Not one even looks in my direction, let alone ask if I need something. I didn't want to be rude and interrupt the interviews being conducted, but after a good ten minutes of waiting, I went to the hostess stand at the entrance. I waited a minute or two before one of the waitresses who previously ignored me came out. I was a little salty with her, I'll admit. I explained that I had been waiting at the bar as the sign says but no one was there to take my order. She said she could take my order and again, I was directed to wait at the bar. Back at the bar, their interviews over, I spoke up to one of the managers about how I had been ignored. She apologized and said she thought someone had waited on me. She then offered to take my order which I told her was unnecessary because I had placed it with a waitress at the hostess stand. A few minutes later, the manager came up to tell me that she had deducted $10 from my bill and apologized again. I wasn't expecting that, but at least it was an admission of their poor customer service. However when I received my to-go bag, I only found one salad and one loaf of bread.  I guess what I'm trying to say is....beware when placing to-go orders. It's probably best to call ahead. The service here is hit or miss on a daily basis, but definitely beyond a miss when trying to get food to go.

They have to have a sign guide you to the hostess stand and even then it's hard to navigate your way. We got there about 2:00 pm so didn't have to wait. We were greeted promptly by a pleasant young woman who took our drink orders. A young man delivered our drinks. Then we had to wait forever for someone to take our order. Finally a waiter stopped by but he literally just stood there. We told him it was our first time in and he didn't ask if we had any questions about the menu or try to sell us an appetizer. He literally just \"stood there.\" The items we ordered included smoked salmon appetizer, spinach artichoke dip, prime rib, classic California roll, bread, margaritas, apple walnut cobbler. The food was not that good. I ordered the prime rib medium well and they had to sear it to bring the temperature up. I know prime rib is a fatty cut of meat but this was almost all fat. It was just awful!! We asked for bread but did not realize until we got the bill there is a separate charge for bread. Of course our \"wonderful\" waiter failed to inform us of this. The spinach artichoke dip was extremely greasy. The best thing we ordered were the margaritas. They were excellent.

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "I've been taking my BMW and Nissan here for about 3 years. In the past year, business seems to have gone up to the point that they CANNOT MAINTAIN PREVIOUS LEVELS OF GOOD OLD FASHIONED \"MOM AND POP\" CUSTOMER SERVICE. Maybe the perfect 5 star rating here has something to do with that, causing business to explode. However, when this happens a business either expands, or customer service declines. Precision imports does not seem to desire expansion, and their customer service has become inconsistent and disorganized.   Trust is vital with your mechanic, and Frank/Al broke trust with me in a few areas. I trusted them up until the past year. Earlier this year Al diagnosed my Nissan with a \"pinhole oil lead causing oil to pool in the back of my engine, replacement required around $500. It's a very common problem in this model.\" I have not seen any oil leaking from the Nissan, but they assured me \"just wait it's going to leak.\"   Later this year, the service engine light came on in my BMW. I trusted that Precision Imports would run appropriate diagnostics. They did not. Instead, they insisted that I had \"run my car too low on gas, which caused the light to come on\" and rebuked me not do let the gas run too low in the future. (I had not recently let my tank get too low, and it had been low in the past but never caused problems with the service engine light). They got the service engine light off, and charged me $45.   A few days later, the service engine light came back on. I thought, ok, the problem must be more serious or a new problem. I brought my car in. After several days of waiting, I called to a rude response that they were \"extremely busy and just hold on we'll call you when it's ready!\" I let it go, and let a few more days go by. I called back again, and was returned \"It's been ready come and get your car!\" When I pointed out the poor customer service politely, I was returned with \"Sorry we've been swamped.\"  When I came to pick my car up, the reason given as to why the light was on astonished me: \"pinhole oil lead causing oil to pool in the back of my engine, replacement required around $500. It's a very common problem in this model.\" SAME SUPPOSED \"COMMON\" PROBLEM AS MY NISSAN WORD FOR WORD! AND, they were unable to switch off my service engine light. I just stared at him. My read: FULL OF BS. I said nothing regarding this diagnosis, paid, and left.  I have googled this problem in both cars, and asked around a little. Neither is a common problem in either car from what I've found. I was even told they have patch kits for the problem, which was never offered to me as an option.  I should add that I also have had 2 \"underquotes\" on mechanical problems here. I mean, quoted by phone at one cost, then when I go to pay it was higher. When I've asked about the higher cost, i feel I was given lines of BS.  WHY DOES A SECOND OPINION MATTER?  The next day I was driving my BMW. Now call me a jackass for not opening my engine and checking the coolant, but the car was JUST serviced (including oil change, etc) at Precision Imports! My car started smoking like crazy, and died on busy Bell road. I was able to get the car into another auto shop. They found out THE COOLANT WAS EMPTY. THIS IS WHY THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. The charge was $10. PROBLEM SOLVED, smooth sailing since.   I have now taken both cars to 2 different mechanics. Nothing has been discovered in the area of \"pinhole oil leak\" on either car.  It used to be that Frank always overstated the price a little, went above and beyond with communication, and took care of me. He came across as an honest old school guy to me. It's different now. Frank's more detached. I get the feeling Frank is eying retirement, and would prefer working on a much much lower volume of cars. No comment on the younger guy Al. Earlier this year when I brought my car in Frank said \"make sure you deal with me.\" I didn't make much of it, but this could have indicated some other issue going on at the shop. I did attempt to deal only with Frank this year, but his availability has been very low and he had to route me to Al and others.  I saw a few guys in the shop with a lot of signs pointing to \"previously convicted felon.\" I'm all about turning it around and 2nd chances, and I realize this can be a staple of many mechanic shops. But, business is business and I didn't get a good feeling about a few of the newer mechanics in the shop.  I gave them several second chances, and communicated my concerns honestly and appropriately. But that's it for me. They lost me as a customer. I'm hoping that they can turn it around, but for starters they are going to need to lose more customers and reduce the extreme volume or expand to a new location.

ON MAJOR ISSUES GET A SECOND OPINION.", "ori_text": "I've been taking my BMW and Nissan here for about 3 years.  In the past year, business seems to have gone up to the point that they CANNOT MAINTAIN PREVIOUS LEVELS OF GOOD OLD FASHIONED \\\"\"MOM AND POP\\\"\" CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Maybe the perfect 5 star rating here has something to do with that, causing business to explode.  However, when this happens a business either expands, or customer service declines.  Precision imports does not seem to desire expansion, and their customer service has become inconsistent and disorganized.  \\n\\nTrust is vital with your mechanic, and Frank/Al broke trust with me in a few areas.  I trusted them up until the past year.  Earlier this year Al diagnosed my Nissan with a \\\"\"pinhole oil lead causing oil to pool in the back of my engine, replacement required around $500.  It's a very common problem in this model.\\\"\"  I have not seen any oil leaking from the Nissan, but they assured me \\\"\"just wait it's going to leak.\\\"\"  \\n\\nLater this year, the service engine light came on in my BMW.  I trusted that Precision Imports would run appropriate diagnostics.  They did not.  Instead, they insisted that I had \\\"\"run my car too low on gas, which caused the light to come on\\\"\" and rebuked me not do let the gas run too low in the future.  (I had not recently let my tank get too low, and it had been low in the past but never caused problems with the service engine light). They got the service engine light off, and charged me $45.  \\n\\nA few days later, the service engine light came back on.  I thought, ok, the problem must be more serious or a new problem.  I brought my car in.  After several days of waiting, I called to a rude response that they were \\\"\"extremely busy and just hold on we'll call you when it's ready!\\\"\"  I let it go, and let a few more days go by.  I called back again, and was returned \\\"\"It's been ready come and get your car!\\\"\"  When I pointed out the poor customer service politely, I was returned with \\\"\"Sorry we've been swamped.\\\"\"\\n\\nWhen I came to pick my car up, the reason given as to why the light was on astonished me: \\\"\"pinhole oil lead causing oil to pool in the back of my engine, replacement required around $500.  It's a very common problem in this model.\\\"\"  SAME SUPPOSED \\\"\"COMMON\\\"\" PROBLEM AS MY NISSAN WORD FOR WORD!  AND, they were unable to switch off my service engine light.  I just stared at him.  My read: FULL OF BS.  I said nothing regarding this diagnosis, paid, and left.\\n\\nI have googled this problem in both cars, and asked around a little.  Neither is a common problem in either car from what I\\\"\"ve found.  I was even told they have patch kits for the problem, which was never offered to me as an option.\\n\\nI should add that I also have had 2 \\\"\"underquotes\\\"\" on mechanical problems here.  I mean, quoted by phone at one cost, then when I go to pay it was higher.

Not only was I standing there, but the people at the kiosk were now finishing up, and another woman with a child was there waiting as well, asking me if someone was working this department.  I asked for a store manager twice after the first page over the intercom, and they just re-paged her again.  10 minutes later, Laura, comes waltzing back and says, yes?  Ummm, I'm sorry, yes? is your response for being gone 30 minutes when people need assistance? If it was a lunch break, or mandatory break, you should have put up a sign!

The whole plaza gives me the creeps (although I do like Yucca tap room and Capistrano's). But besides the plaza giving me the uneasy feeling, that even an unattractive mid-aged man could fall victim to a mid-day rape, I forged on. The rewards were less than stellar. I cruised the aisles of items looking for something I could purchase to add to my already cluttered abode. No dice. Everything is in that weird period, where it isn't old enough to be collectible, cool, or culturally relevant yet nothing is new enough to provide an upgrade. The only thing I thought was cool was a couple obscure punk CDs in the music section, but I already had the albums on my IPOD. I didn't see anyone else buying anything either but everyone did stop to talk to the old cooter working the register. He looks like he may be a plethora of knowledge and stories. I'm not trying to steer people away, just saying I didn't have any luck, but then again I didn't seek guidance from the wrinkled prophet dishing advise and offering a safe harbor to those fearing the dayrape.", "concepts": "price"}

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "I asked my doctor to switch me from Phoenix Perinatal because of the complete lack of organization and ability to follow through. The price for their services is exorbitant, considering the subpar level of care and service they provide. I had a first trimester US, genetic screening, and consult on July 14 at the Chandler office. This was a second appointment, the first one had to be rescheduled because the doctor was out of the office. When I got there, no one had any patient information on me, even though I was referred from my regular OB's office over 3 weeks prior. I guess no one had thought to request medical records from my OB prior to the appointment? So they tried to get my medical records while I spent the next hour in my appointment, but apparently things just weren't working in their favor that day.  The appointment went well - the US tech was great, the Doctor was great, and I felt like they took time to explain all my options and fully review everything with me. Then when I got done, the doctor explained to the receptionist that he was recommending \"Co-Managed\" care and that they should set up a next appointment for my second trimester, as well as fetal echo monitoring starting at 18 weeks. Well, again, there was some confusion over scheduling that - I wasn't sure if it was due to the lack of medical records or a glitch in their computers, but they told me to take a card and wait for them to call me to make an appointment. But you know, if I didn't hear from them in a few days I should call in and make my appointment. Well of course.  So a week goes by and I don't get a call about an appointment. So I call in and try to make an appointment as I was instructed, but the receptionist doesn't seem to have any record of the Doctor's recommendation and insists I need a referral from my doctor before she can schedule me - which of course is the first time I'm hearing anything about my regular OB needing to give me another referral. I ask to speak to a supervisor and get put on hold for 15 min, after which point I got tired of waiting and hung up. Later, the supervisor calls me back and apologizes, but insists I need a referral because there is no mention of co-managed care in my records.  I did get an automated message that my screening results were in, but when I called the hotline to get the pre-recorded message with my results, it told me it couldn't find me in the system. So I had to call the advice nurse, who was very helpful and provided my results. Then for the next week I continued to get daily automated calls telling me to call the hotline and get my results - which of course were never there - until I guess the \"number of times to call before giving up\" limit was reached.  I had my OB's office fax a referral for the second trimester over to Phx Perinatal. Still no call for an appointment as I'm approaching 15 weeks. When I call them to find out what the status is, they tell me they have no referral on file. Then they further tell me that they don't even start fetal echo monitoring until 22 weeks, so I don't need to be seen for awhile. Are you even kidding me, a RECEPTIONIST is making decisions about how and when my high-risk pregnancy should be monitored, despite the doctor's recommendation? I ask my OB to send the referral again and STILL Phoenix Perinatal claims they didn't receive it. They still won't schedule an appointment for me, so finally, completely fed up, I ask my doctor to refer me to another high-risk clinic.  To put the icing on the cake, I then get a voicemail today that I missed an appointment on Aug 4 at Phoenix Perinatal and I need to reschedule. When I call the receptionist, she claims I must've made the appointment and forgotten. NO, Phoenix Perinatal, I've been TRYING to make an appointment for WEEKS now and you guys don't know what the heck you are doing from one moment to the next. This is the most disorganized and unprofessional medical establishment I have ever dealt with, and while there may be some very good doctors working for this practice, it's hard to put any faith in them to see my baby born healthy with a staff and organization that is run the way it is. Not only do I have a complete lack of confidence in Phoenix Perinatal, but the fact that they are tied so closely to Banner Desert, which is where I was considering having my child, does not inspire confidence either.

In becoming a loyal customer I purchased an unlimited membership month to month contract with an enrollment charge. After considering the monthly cost and accruing that charge month over month I decided it was not a beneficial bill for me. I ended up calling them in June 2013 to cancel my membership in which I was informed the process would have to be an in person cancelation including a hefty cancelation fee. With that being said, and to much of my annoyance, I proceeded to cancel my membership in person at an additional charge including the next months membership charge (note to self: I'm not renting an apartment to have to abide by similar policies). Subsequently after noticing continuing $43.95 monthly charges (when not utilizing their service for over 9 months) for the next 6 months I contacted my bank to place a stop payment due to the fact they are no longer an authorized merchant. I was then advised by my bank to dispute my claim to the owner, in which I did. Thereafter, to my dismay, the owner, Jim, called back a month later. The owner then continued to state, he \\\"\"deals with a lot of people like myself who lie, if this was L.A.

I asked him his full name and he avoided my question twice then hung up. I called back to his direct line immediately after, no answer. I called back again, no answer. He's now avoiding my calls.

So I was up to the task, but the crab meat inside was just very mediocre and a bit discolored....measly, not plump and luscious. The garlic potatoes accompanying my crab were dry, and I had to keep taking drinks of water between each bite. My husband's steak was the worst.

I went back there to ask them if they had found it and they let me look around a bit. It had only been no more than 15 minutes since I had left there and it was no where to be found. One of the employees there tried to tell me that it could have slipped under the drain, which is impossible because this panel is over 6\\\"\"x 8\\\"\" and would not have slipped through the grate. All I got in response to this was a simple \\\"\"sorry\\\"\" and no offer of anything to make it up. I had to buy a $100 replace for both mirrors as they are not sold individually. Personally, since I looked everywhere for it myself, I'm thinking the piece may have been run over by another customer's car after mine and they just threw away the evidence.", "concepts": "price"}

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "I enrolled my son at this place to socialize and learn, but I am disappointed with this school, especially considering the price. In this review, I will share some incidents and facts.  Incidents: 1. On 04/07/2014, at almost 3:30 PM, I went to pick up my three-year-old son. When I entered the classroom, I found Ms Sandy and Ms Blanca (teachers of the 2-3 years old class), both in the classroom with 1 student eating her snack. The rest of the class was playing in the playground alone and unsupervised. While asking Ms Sandy how my son's day was, I suddenly saw him running to me and crying from pain. His face was covered with dirt and his left eye was injured with some blood on his eyelid. I asked him to explain what happened. He took my hand and walked me to the playground where he showed me a small blue chair. His friends told me that he turned the chair over and he hurt his left outer eye lid and bumped his head. His left outer eye lid with scrap, he had a scratched bridge on his nose. Then I looked at Ms Blanca and I told her: \"can you explain what just happened?\" She said: \"I was cleaning, but the kids told me that my son turned the chair over and jumped through it\". When did the kids tell her if she was cleaning the classroom when I entered the class? That means that my son was injured and neglected without any care. They did not even feel sorry about that and they let me question all that without even thinking to clean his eye and face! His eye was injured and his face was full of dirt which might infect his injured eye! Blanca added that all kids do that and my son imitates them. I said: \"you should not let them do that in the first place. This is very dangerous\". That is not acceptable to leave 25 kids playing unsupervised. This is putting 25 kids in danger. She replied that I was speaking with Sandy and that is why nobody was supervising the kids! That is absurd and ridiculous! because when I entered both of them were in the classroom and the kids were outside. Sandy should send Blanca for a minute or 2 to supervise the kids while she was in the classroom for their safety. Later, Ms Sandy cleaned my son's face and gave him an ice pack after I confronted them. They lack complete children emergency process. (http://hsapps.azdhs.gov/ls/sod/Facility.aspx?FacId=CDC3824)  Bad Leadership: Stephanie, director, defended the teachers not to ruin the school's reputation! When my husband called to inform her about this incident and to express our anger, she did not handle the situation well. She was like \"What do you want?\" The owner of the place did not even call us to see what happened, to apologize, or to sympathize with us.  2. Last month, I found two girls from the 4-5 years old class bathing my son with dirt. His hair, eyes, and clothes were covered with dirt but he did not know that they were bullying him. Ms Blanca and the teacher of the 4-5 years class were supervising but they did not stop the girls from doing that. I confronted Ms Blanca, and she said she was sorry and that will never happen again.  3. One time I went and saw him wearing pull up without pants on and he was playing in the playground. They did not even think to call me to ask me to bring more clothes.  4. TV is tuned on every day. Why is that? Are they short of academic activities?  5. One day I went at 10:00 AM to see how my son was doing because he was newly enrolled. I was surprised to see the teacher of the 4-5 years old yelling at the students of the 2-3 years old because there was water on the floor! This teacher did not expect to see me in the classroom at that time.  6. Another time I found my son digging a hole with his friend while putting his entire head in the dirt. His eyes were also covered with sand along with his nose and cheeks. When I asked Sandy and Blanca, they laughed! And they said that my son and his friend are trying to escape! How funny!?  7. On March 24, 2014, I picked my son from school, and I asked him how was his day and whether anyone hit him. He said that Ms Sandy did. So I asked some parents to collect information about this incident from their little ones. But all of them said that this incident did not happen. I also called Blanca who said that the only incident that she witnessed was hearing Sandy YELLING at my son because she thought that he was kicking the toy oven while trying to take a nap, but then she figured out that it was not my son who was doing that. The following day, I went to the school and asked Ms sandy what happened in front of the director. She said that she made him sit on his bottom but did not hit him. I believed her because I know how she treats her students.  8. He was getting sick every week.  9. Only 1 common bathroom with only two toilet tanks for both 3-4 and 4-5 classrooms  10. When he was first enrolled, I was told that he will learn some new Spanish words. He actually did not learn any single Spanish word.

The white bread was not toasted and completely dried out, and to make matters worse, it was MOLDY. There was also no mayo on it, which wouldn't have made a difference because I wouldn't have eaten it anyway.

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "NEVER have I been stranded at an airport because a reserved car was unavailable, leaving me feeling frustrated and disappointed with Enterprise. I arrived on time in Madison with a confirmed reservation made through their website, only to be met with a long wait at the counter while the agent chatted on the phone. When I finally handed over my ID and credit card and mentioned my reservation, I was told they were out of cars and offered no alternatives or assistance. The agent's rude and offensive demeanor only added to my frustration. To make matters worse, she gleefully informed me that there were fourteen others in the same predicament. Thankfully, my travel companion had a reservation with HERTZ, who handled things professionally and quickly. I ended up relying on him for a ride to my hotel and will have to deal with this ordeal in the morning. Needless to say, I will never rent from Enterprise again. Tonight's experience was truly awful, and the agent's behavior did not reflect well on the Madison area. My advice to others is not to assume that a reservation with Enterprise guarantees a car. It may be better to cancel and go with a more reputable company.", "ori_text": "NEVER have I been stranded at an airport because a reserved vehicle was unavailable.

Last night, the two of us decided to walk in early (about 6:00 P.M. on a Friday night, our date night) and were immediately seated. We were put in a back room containing two large, long tables and a few tables for four. One of the large tables was already filled with about 20 people, and the noise was deafening. That entire room apparently has nothing on the walls or ceiling to absorb noise. We noticed that, at one of the tables for four, people were getting up and leaving without ordering. Even worse, the place has a lot of young children who were constantly running around and getting in the way of the waitstaff which, by the way, was excellent.  We started with two Ketel One on the rocks. When ordering a second round, we were told they had run out of Ketel One--at 6:15 on a Friday night. We then split a Waldhorn salad, which was good. We both had the sauerbraten with spaeztle and red cabbage. The meat was dry and the spaetzle didn't even look or taste like spaetzle. From our experience, spaetzle are dumplings pressed through a sieve.. This stuff looked and tasted more like doughy noodles. Since I love Black Forest cake, I took a piece home.
