Our Vegas trip wasn't a golf trip so we didn't want to kill the bank with a high end course over $150. Well...I've heard of Wildhorse and saw that the green fees were reasonable for Vegas standards (still $80).   Thinking we only had two in our group, we'd get out there to the starter early and possibly get out earlier than our tee time, wrong. We were stuck behind four or five groups of hacking, loud, partying, beer drinking Canadians. FAIL. Our round was about 5.5 hours! Another FAIL.   The driving range was nice and you actually hit off grass but with those kinds of green fees, the course should of gave out free range/warm up balls! FAIL.  Course? It was okay and super short. I maybe used my driver (yes, my #1 wood) only 3-4 times out of 18 holes. I mainly teed off with my 3 wood, hybrid and 3 iron the course was that short. FAIL. No challenging enough because I should a 9 over 79 (par 70). I'm usually a bogey golfer. I did manage to make all my good putts. Greens? Dry and slow.   Bathrooms on the course? Maybe 1 or 2 out there WITHOUT running water to wash your hands. Just a bottle of hand sanitizer. FAIL FAIL.   Drinking fountains on the course? Coolers with cold water and ice for the course? Big 5-gallon ice water dispensers on course? NO...just an empty wooden place to put the 5-gallon dispenser, and no water. FAIL FAIL FAIL. What happens when the weather's 110'f? Yeah..it was only 80'f this past weekend and we had our own water and Gatorade so we were lucky.   Water girl? Yeah...they were cute, but unfortunately they came around when we were at hole 3 (yeah early) and hole 17 (we were nearly done with our round).   All in all a pretty crappy experience as I rate Wildhorse 2.5 stars at best. We were paired with two other older brothers from NY which was totally awesome. They were funny AF. I guess if you're a Vegas resident, you'd pay a heck of a lot less. Unfortunately for out of towners like my brother and I, we overpaid for this public course.

It was like ordering a meal at a restaurant and getting the wrong dish. The technician showed up and started working on my AC unit instead of the evaporative cooler.

It was like having a poorly cooked meal that left you hungry and disappointed. To make matters worse, water started running out of the vent in my kitchen the next morning. When I called to complain, I was met with a very rude and unhelpful person named Ken. He gruffly said he would take care of it himself, but he never did.

If they do a good job I suppose it's excusable.  \\n\\nI decide to leave the bike there.  The mechanic says I can pick it up around 5:00pm or so.  \\n\\nHalfway through the day, I get a phone call from the mechanic.  He says the tension pulley is defective and suggests I take my new bike back to the store.  A few minutes later he calls me again to tell me the problem is 'fixed, but he wants me to keep an eye on it -- and I can come pick it up' (is this so he can actually charge me some money?).\\n\\nI pick it up, get insulted one more time (\\\"\"Where did you buy this bike?  Toy-R-Us?\\\"\"), pay $40, walk out, and I'm immediately able to reproduce the same problem.  \\n\\nIn (previous reviewer) Sarah's defense:\\nIt appears that ownership of this store changed in August 2008.

My cookie is stale, as it always is, but the coffee is still delicious. That said, I don't know what about today has compelled me to finally write this review, as opposed to any other day, but it has been a long time coming despite the fact that nothing about my CTR experience has changed.   To first address the cookie. I'm going to cut CTR some slack on the cookie because I tend to attend the cafe late in the evening, so I don't know if it's day-old staleness that I'm getting at the end of every day or if it's week-old staleness that even morning caf\u00e9 go-ers experience as well. Given the turnover rate of the baristas/sales associates at CTR, their detachment and general disinterest in their jobs, I will never have the opportunity to learn the truth about the cookies through potentially sharing a human conversation.   I cannot tell you how bittersweet my afternoons are at Coffee Tree Roasters--Shadyside. But it could be worse. I far prefer any CTR over any Crazy Mocha. In comparison CTR has coffee (rather than the tasteless shit Crazy Mocha serves), they have more intimately designed spaces, better furniture, and CTR's appeal is more carefully crafted to the demographic of each location. Put simply, it's the better Pittsburgh coffee chain.  Every day that I caffeinate at CTR--Shadyside I am reminded of how impersonal chain-run coffee shops are. The truth of the matter is that, like most people at CTR--Shadyside, I live in the neighborhood, which translates to spending 10% of my life at CTR. Still, none of the baristas/sales associates have ever, nor likely will ever, acknowledge that they recognize me. For some reason I expect them to remember that I get the same medium drip every time, with room for cream. In the very least, a shallow mirroring of my acknowledgement of our everyday interaction would be nice. The nature of our interaction is this: they ask me what they can get me, I pay them with my CC, they swipe my CC and simply put their hand to the receipt-printer while mentioning in the same repeatable tone \"and if you could sign this please....\" which often makes me wonder whether or not they ever recognize me in the first place. Of course I know that I need to sign the receipt. This is right around the same time that I realize that they haven't left enough room for cream in my coffee and I ask them to pour some out.   These baristas/sales associates are students or mid-twenties recent graduates from the nearby private schools. They are not exactly the most present, nor interested baristas/sales associates in the world but I understand it's just a job, rather than something they love to do. Upon closer observation each and every one of them feels a bit nervous, socially awkward and anxious to serve the next customer. There was one barista/sales associate I liked in July, but he lasted for one month.  Aside from the human experience, CTR--Shadyside has a nice layout. It's a long, narrow space and low ceiling creates a living-room feel (not to mention two living-room couch collections situated in the center of it's 60' length coffee shop facilitates great group/family conversations). There is an office room in the back with walls of glass and a door, which pretty much seals all sound out, with the exception of the adjacent bathroom doors opening/closing which can be annoying because these bathrooms always seem to be in use (which makes sense because this caf\u00e9 seats roughly 40 people at any given time). I can tell you from personal experience that the female bathroom is poorly ventilated and generally smells like it is poorly ventilated, especially later in the evening.  But of course, they have good internet. When you open your browser you are prompted to accept their basic internet-use terms. The interface then counts down for 2 hours, at which point you may return to the register to ask for an extension and they will hand you a commercial post-it with a unique password pre-printed, granting you another 2 hours. Honestly, I haven't stayed at CTR for longer than 4 hours, but I am sure the barista/sales associate wouldn't mind giving you another additional 2 hours.  Perhaps in the end the taste of stale salted-pretzel cookies keeps bringing me back, perhaps I just have a soft spot for them. And yes, they have a fantastic assortment of cookies, cakes, and chocolate covered espresso beans as well. But still, while CTR Shadyside claims to be well-rated by City Search, it's pure sillyness. If you want good coffee in Pittsburgh go to Espresso A Mano in Lawrenceville or Tazza D'orro in highland park/CMU campus. CTR Shadyside is a typical Wi-fi hot spot, nothing special.

Maybe there's something wrong with my palate, but to be honest, I'm pretty certain that there's not. East side institution? What a joke!", "concepts": "food"}

We loved our night, but that was mostly because we were with this young guy who we don't get to see very often.

The service was great, and they brought a few strawberries and some whipped cream as an anniversary treat for us. We like Coup des Tartes but the only time we can afford going here is when they offer a Groupon or some discount. Honestly, the prices on their regular menu are just sky high. It's very disconcerting when you first walk in and look at the menu. I hate to see another restaurant that we enjoy being converted to another one of those places that ONLY works when you have a Groupon in hand.   I'd like to suggest to the owners of Coup des Tartes that they take a serious look at the menu pricing and cut it back a bit.

I originally gave it a three star rating. I think their food does still merit a 3 star, but I am going to downgrade them one notch for the way I was treated the other day.   We had a Groupon (yes, they still focus on those promos) and it was going to expire in five or six days. We left a message early AM for a reservation for that night, and then never had a returned call. That was the first bad sign. When we called back and spoke to the owner, the guy was rude and just plain nasty. No, they had no reservations that night, and the other nights we suggested (mid-week) they couldn't get us in before 9 or 9:30 and so on . . .  Later, I called Groupon and asked what they suggest. They told me that as long as you make your reservation before the cut off date, the restaurant will still honor your full value of the Groupon on the date you go in, even though it is after expiration. I called and unfortunately the same guy got on the line. \"No way\" he replied - \"That's not how we work Groupons. You only get half the value - the amount you paid.\" So I put him on the line with the Groupon rep, who told us both that the guy has to honor the Groupon. Well, he opted not to do so and hung up. Honestly, this restaurant is cute and the food's not bad, but with an owner like this, why patronize them?

The aircraft selection is just ok.  A couple of decommissioned fighter jets, an experimental aircraft or two, shiny old Piedmont passenger plane and a small handful of others.  Most of the aircraft are roped off, however three to four are not and with supervision, you can sit in a cockpit or two.  The hangar includes a few glass case displays, isn't very well lit and smells a little of motor oil (to be expected I guess).  Apparently there are a few more aircraft outside but due to a security issue, there is no access to those.  The show stopper is the Miracle in the Hudson US Airways airplane.  As  of July 2nd, it's still being assembled but is on display with a rolling video feature of a TV documentary detailing the actual events.  The first thing I noticed was that it's LITTERED with corporate logos.  That's terribly disappointing.

My hope is that those will be removed at some point and the museum will allow people to actually board the plane.

If I was their corporate office I would rethink things they need to be more walk in friendly and respectful of people's time , I will give them their prices are great for brides on a budget and do have beautiful dresses but customer service lacks and that's huge for me . I'm still in search for my dress I did find one I liked there but won't purchase unless I get a discount for my experience .", "concepts": "food"}

I went to this restaurant because of the excellent reviews on Yelp and the close proximity to my place of work.  First problem: I called the restaurant on a Monday (March 24) and they were able to get me a reservation with a chef the very next day. However, I called out of fear of having food poisoning. When I get to the restaurant (March 25), the host asks me, \"Oh you're just here about food concerns, correct?\" I said, \"No, I'm here because of a possible food poisoning and I told this to the person that gave me the reservation.\" The host was very confused and said they would probably not have the time to address any food safety issues. VERY disappointing and completely off-base. How do you go from food poisoning to food concerns?  Second problem: The chef's name was Margaret. She did not have any information for me regarding food safety (she did not even ask). Right away, she said it sounded like food poisoning and seemed to just want to take some food samples and send me on my way. Finally, she decided to do a food inspection. She showed very little compassion and had a horrible attitude. I was very uncomfortable around her.  After the inspection, she had me wait and come out for more food samples. She handed me a brochure regarding food handling and safety and left me with the person that would be serving my food. She told me to come back in 2 days at the same time.  My husband and I left the restaurant and I called the health department where I had been seen and initially found out about the food poisoning to get my previous test results. I then called this restaurant back to make sure they gave those results to Margaret so she could check them against the new food samples.  The next day (March 26), Margaret called me to tell me that the results were positive for food poisoning and this was a good thing. However, she failed to check her results against the results I had called the previous day to give them. She then checks them over and goes, \"Oh... no, they are negative... looks like it's not food poisoning.\" JUST LIKE THAT!!!! All nonchalant, like she's telling me I wasn't the 19th caller for some damn concert tickets. How horrible of a person can you be to tell someone that they have food poisoning like it's no big deal???  I then called her restaurant manager and left a message. She never returned my call. That was on Wednesday, March 26th.  NEVER will I ever go back to this place again. It's unfortunate that I did not get to meet/see the head chef. she really needs to consider getting rid of Margaret.", "ori_text": "HORRIBLE experience!

When my husband went shopping for jewelry for me, he was told that there is an extra charge for earring posts.

Even when I tried to exchange a necklace for a shorter chain, they told me that I would have to drop it off, wait until the next day, and pay a charge to have it shortened.

Thankfully, the two employees my husband worked with and the one that helped me were able to resolve these issues. They comped the earring posts and corrected my chain at no charge.

He was busy talking to his girlfriend who was also working.  \\n\\nI ate about 1/2 of the burger and asked for the check.  The bartender brought the check and didn't say a word, or ask why I only at about 1/2 of the burger.  Overall a very disappointing experience.", "concepts": "food"}

And my brother used to work here over 2 decades ago when we were in college. Oh, I wrote that before.  Oops. Today, Guadalupe (I think that's her name) served us at the drive through.  She is fairly new that I can tell of the past couple weeks.  She never smiles and is always curt.  Today, upon buying 3 large drinks (and I wasn't happy that the prices went up on this, too to $1), I handed her my debit card and my daughter's school ID.  She said she cannot accept the school ID and that I will not be getting a 10% on the drinks.  She said they are already discounted.  I said they raised the prices like about a week ago. She told me the drinks are normally $2.50.  I don't think they've been that price in ever, not even in Vegas are they this much.  She said we were already getting a discount and they don't do discounts on their $1 menu.  I said, well, the sign right there said, they always give 10% to students (with IDs), veterans, military, senior citizens.  Then, she went on to say, it's only for the veterans and military that they will give 10% off. Anyway, she refused and it's not even that I need or even care about the stupid 30 cents, but the principle.  I told her yesterday I got the 10% off, but she didn't address that.  How they she say they only give 10% off to military when the sign there clearly says to whom.  And, the sign does not have an asterisk stating that the 10% is for certain items only. We frequently other Carl Jr's around the valley and have always gotten the 10% off our drinks or whatever we are buying.

She is fairly new that I can tell of the past couple weeks.  She never smiles and is always curt.  Today, upon buying 3 large drinks (and I wasn't happy that the prices went up on this, too to $1), I handed her my debit card and my daughter's school ID.  She said she cannot accept the school ID and that I will not be getting a 10% on the drinks.  She said they are already discounted.  I said they raised the prices like about a week ago.\\n\\nShe told me the drinks are normally $2.50.  I don't think they've been that price in ever, not even in Vegas are they this much.  She said we were already getting a discount and they don't do discounts on their $1 menu.  I said, well, the sign right there said, they always give 10% to students (with IDs), veterans, military, senior citizens.  Then, she went on to say, it's only for the veterans and military that they will give 10% off.\\n\\nAnyway, she refused and it's not even that I need or even care about the stupid 30 cents, but the principle.  I told her yesterday I got the 10% off, but she didn't address that.  How they she say they only give 10% off to military when the sign there clearly says to whom.  And, the sign does not have an asterisk stating that the 10% is for certain items only.\\n\\nWe frequently other Carl Jr's around the valley and have always gotten the 10% off our drinks or whatever we are buying.

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "On 8/23, I went to the Aveda store in PV Mall to pick out my Pure Privilege birthday gift. Since the store was busy, I went to the makeup to see if anything interested me. After a few minutes, an associate asked if I needed any help picking out colors. I smiled and waved the certificate in my hand and said, \"nope - I'm here to pick out my birthday gift today!\" I was excited to pick out a new fragrance since the patchouli blend I've always worn was discontinued. I've gone through the experience at least five or six times, so I was looking forward to sitting down and going through the options.  The associate said, \"Oh, well, you also have your double points certificate\" and proceeded to their back room to put her drink cup away. I continued looking at makeup. She came back, walked to the registers, and says to the customer being rung up, \"I haven't seen you in so long!\" and then chats for a moment before walking over to the table where she started pulling out the oil blends. She didn't say a word to me. I looked over after a minute, and she had a few of the bottles uncapped and lined up. I put down the makeup and started to walk towards the table. She still hadn't said anything to me about how we were going to walk through the experience, if she was ready for me, what I should be doing...nothing. So I stood about four feet away from the table, waiting for her to acknowledge me. At this point, she gestured at the stool and said, \"You can sit down.\" So I did, and then I waited because she was still uncapping bottles and setting them in a row. When I didn't reach for any of the bottles, she looked at me and said in a snide tone, \"You can start anytime.\" I was floored. First, that she spoke to me in that tone and second because I know this isn't how Aveda does things. Going into an Aveda store is always a treat. You're greeted. You're offered tea. The associates talk to you and suggestively sell and offer you a moment of wellness. You almost forget how much money you're spending on product because they make it an experience.  In that moment, I was so shocked that I actually just did what she told me and started sniffing the bottles. I eliminated a few, but I still had four in front of me, and I said, \"Hmm, I can't choose between these four,\" thinking that she would ask questions to help me narrow down a choice. I got silence. By this point, I am not only disappointed because I'm not being \"pampered\" (which to me is more fun than the actual free product), but I'm being given the silent treatment. There is no conversation, no \"so what are you doing for your birthday,\" no acknowledgement that I'm in there for a special treat, no acknowledgement that I'm a Pure Privilege member, nothing. Just an associate standing next to me, alternately watching me smelling bottles and staring into space. I assume she had better things to do than to take care of me.  I went on to ask about the notes in the other bottles, and then because I was so awkwardly uncomfortable with the whole situation between the silence and the staring, I just picked one and said, \"This is the one I'd like.\"  She flipped the bottle onto the base and let it drain. In complete silence. When it was done, she hurriedly stuffed it into the envelope, handed me the envelope, and chirped, \"There you go!\" She hadn't even bothered to mark the envelope with my choice. So as she turns away from me and starts putting the bottles back, I walk over to the counter to ask to borrow a pen. She finally gestures at me so that I cannot pretend not to see her and says to me with an exaggerated fake smile on her face (she didn't smile at me the entire time she was \"helping\" me), \"Can I help you with something?\" I said, \"I would like to borrow a pen, please, because you didn't mark down which blend I chose.\" She replies in a syrupy, cheerfully fake voice, \"Oh here, let me do that for you\" and takes the envelope from me. She hands it back and says, \"Can I offer you a moment of wellness?\" I lost it. I said, \"No, you can't. You should have done that from the beginning. You have completely ruined my birthday treat AND my afternoon.\" And I proceeded to be something I have never been in a retail store before - an incredibly angry customer.  I have gotten bad and nonexistent service in lots of places, but none that ever made me feel this way or provoked this kind of reaction from me. I did not get the woman's name, but she had dark brown, wavy, shoulder-length hair and glasses. The team at the Fashion Sq. store has always been fabulous. I will never go to PV again.

I have to say, that's THE ONLY positive thing I have to say about this place, everything else is TERRIBLE :( I can't talk about all of their dishes (some look better than others) but the pasta they served, especially the one they served ME, was extremely poor quality and overpriced - you can get the same dish from another restaurant for much better prices and they won't give you the fake ingredients either. What happened to me is that the dish I wanted was on display in the menu and the waiter brought me some other pasta from their kitchen - it looked about the same if you don't look closely but it is a fake. The quality is really low, it had a different taste and texture, but he claimed it's the same dish and if I wanted it, I had to buy it. Well, either the chef makes really lousy pasta (which I doubt) or the fake brand pasta I got served was just not the real thing because it was flavorless and the noodles were so overcooked that they immediately turned to mush. Lesson learned: even if the dish looks good on the outside (almost like the authentic brand!) and even if it's served in a fancy restaurant, it might not be worth the $50 \"deal.\" Do yourself a favor, go to a real Italian restaurant, this place has overpriced and poor quality food and I would highly recommend against eating there. Last thing, I don't think people appreciate being called \"honey\" in a condescending voice by someone who only cares about profit, and being told lies for that matter!

I give this place 0 stars although im rating it as 1 star to make this post.. I feel sorry for anyone who thinks this place is a great esablishment to drink and eat.  Hold on, I wouldn't even call this place an establishment  The owner is a total lowlife and feel sorry for anyone who works for him.  Extremely rude.  I will make sure none of my friends go to this dive bar and will spread the word.  I suggest to Stay away from this place if you don't like getting ridiculed and insulted upon by the owner..  It's a nuisance to the neighborhood.   ************************STAY AWAY**********************\\n\\nThere are some things that I do agree with other posts on this subject such as, Jimbo's is definately not a place for kids and I wish I had realized that before I decided to go there.   It was more imature for this 60 year old man to tell a 15 year old that he is a fat pig when people in line are cheering him on to take more wings and then proceed to come over to my table to change out a paper towel roll knowing what had just occurred(almost like he was instigating a fight).  This is where the real imatureness really begins.  Now that I know not to take my son to this so called \\\"\"adult Themed Bar\\\"\"...ha(more like alcoholic themed Bar), I myself and many others to whom i'm good friends with will not be going to this bar as well.", "concepts": "food"}

The food, especially the breakfast options, was pretty good. The service was good as far as I remember and I wanted to go back sometime, maybe try the lunch menu.   We went back last night and had a totally different food experience. It was late and we did have 2 children with us, the baby who is now 3 months old and her 2 year old brother. We had just been to the Phoenix Children's Museum for their free Friday night sponsored by Target and we were all tired and hungry. We came in here in the hope that we could get some good food so we wouldn't have to cook when we got home. In fact we picked this place because it is a \"family restaurant\" that is known to have kid-friendly options. Wrong.   The little boy was understandably fussy so I appreciate that this was not something fun for the waiter but at the same time when you're in the service industry sometimes you just have to deal with it when things happen like a fussy 2 year old. We did the best we could to keep it under control. I ended up taking him outside twice to soothe and distract him. We ordered his meal first and asked the waiter could he please make sure that got put in while we decided what we wanted to eat and actually the 2 year old was fine once his food arrived (until he'd finished eating his fill).   It took us awhile to order because of the distractions. I ordered a fancy grilled cheese sandwich with bacon, side of onion rings, my daughter got a cheeseburger with french fries, and he got some sort of chicken tenders Kids Meal with french fries, which we were all munching on because we were hungry. Because he was tired he started getting antsy again once he was done. I finally convinced my daughter to call the dad and have him come to get the child so we could eat in peace. I waited to ask our server for a container to put the rest of the toddler's food in but he never showed up so I chucked the water out of a paper cup and put the food in there. I went up to the manager at the cash register to let him know I was stepping outside just to give the food to the mom and he ignored me and didn't respond, even picked up the phone as if he was making a phone call. Rude! I just didn't want him to think I was skipping out on the bill.   The bottom line is that the waiter, Lyle, was not polite to us. He was as cranky as the 2 year old. I understand it was difficult for him but it's his job to be as pleasant as possible to his customers regardless and we certainly weren't doing or saying anything to be rude to him. Obviously we were struggling just to be able to order and to read the menu. He let it be known he was not happy with us which I'm NOT used to. I'm used to a really nice waiters and waitresses and servers and just don't have a problem with people because I'm a nice friendly person myself.   I pretty much always tip 20%, I mean it's been years since I left less than a 20% tip, I can't even REMEMBER the last time I left less than 20%. But last night our bill came to $ 21.89 and I just added $1.11 to the credit card receipt because the service was so bad.   From the time he brought the food till we were done and sitting there waiting, it was 30 minutes and he never even stopped by to see if there was anything else we needed, and we could've used more napkins and water.   The manager was also very unfriendly. I'm staying in a motel and eat out everyday so I know how servers and managers are supposed to act.

We sat for 15 minutes before a server even came over which was ok since we were chatting but we sure got thirsty. A server came over and asked if we had been helped yet and when we said no she said she was likely not going to be our server, but she'd take our drink order. Turns out, she was our server for the night. We could have done better serving ourselves at that rate. It took another 12 minutes to get our drinks.

Ultimately, it took our party of 5 more than 2 hours to eat food at Rock Bottom. We had 3 different appetizers which we took advantage of the happy hour prices. We had to remind the server that we were to get the 1/2 price appetizers when she brought our check. We had to beg for refills of drinks, ask where our dinners were, and it was like pulling teeth to get service.

I write this review to warn others and to try and spare you the headaches that we have experienced.  You are welcome to contact me with any questions and I am happy to share any documentation you would care to see.\\n\\nSo here is what happened:\\n\\nWe had Troy Lowe, Field Supervisor and the sales guy out to look at some windows for replacement on a home we had purchased.  Our first experience was good, we got a good price and they were able to provide us with the custom windows we wanted.  \\n\\nWe decided to move forward and Troy was scheduled to come back out and remeasure the windows just to make sure everything was right before fabrication.  Troy never showed.  Instead, we were assured that they had what they needed.  About two weeks later we got a call that our windows were in.  We scheduled installation.  \\n\\nThe windows were installed on November 10th.  The crew was polite, helpful and careful around our newly installed landscaping.  During installation a problem arose.  The windows, while custom made, were not the proper depth.  After installation, there was a 1/2\\\"\" to 5/8\\\"\" gap all the way around each of the windows.  A 1/4\\\"\" or less is standard.  I had three construction guys out to take a look, including a licensed general contractor and every one told us that the window were either measured wrong, made wrong or installed wrong - the gap was too big to caulk and would need drywall and joint compound.  \\n\\nWe called True View on the 11th and talked to our customer service rep, Rebecca, to let then know about our concerns and to work with them to get it resolved.  Rebecca assured us that our happiness and customer satisfaction was paramount to the company.  We assured Rebecca that we were happy to work with them to achieve a solution that worked for both sides.  If we could find a way to fix the gap on the inside we were fine to keep the windows. We understand the cost of re-fabricating the windows and our goal was not to put a local business out of business.  \\n\\nThe four weeks that followed have been a trial of patience, rudeness, lies and excuses from Troy and True View Windows and Glass.

We asked them not to waste their time or caulk given the caulk around the South facing windows would have to be replaced every one to two years or so.

I write this review to warn others and to try and spare you the headaches that we have experienced.  You are welcome to contact me with any questions and I am happy to share any documentation you would care to see.\\n\\nSo here is what happened:\\n\\nWe had Troy Lowe, Field Supervisor and the sales guy out to look at some windows for replacement on a home we had purchased.  Our first experience was good, we got a good price and they were able to provide us with the custom windows we wanted.  \\n\\nWe decided to move forward and Troy was scheduled to come back out and remeasure the windows just to make sure everything was right before fabrication.  Troy never showed.  Instead, we were assured that they had what they needed.  About two weeks later we got a call that our windows were in.  We scheduled installation.  \\n\\nThe windows were installed on November 10th.  The crew was polite, helpful and careful around our newly installed landscaping.  During installation a problem arose.  The windows, while custom made, were not the proper depth.  After installation, there was a 1/2\\\"\" to 5/8\\\"\" gap all the way around each of the windows.  A 1/4\\\"\" or less is standard.  I had three construction guys out to take a look, including a licensed general contractor and every one told us that the window were either measured wrong, made wrong or installed wrong - the gap was too big to caulk and would need drywall and joint compound.  \\n\\nWe called True View on the 11th and talked to our customer service rep, Rebecca, to let then know about our concerns and to work with them to get it resolved.  Rebecca assured us that our happiness and customer satisfaction was paramount to the company.  We assured Rebecca that we were happy to work with them to achieve a solution that worked for both sides.  If we could find a way to fix the gap on the inside we were fine to keep the windows. We understand the cost of re-fabricating the windows and our goal was not to put a local business out of business.  \\n\\nThe four weeks that followed have been a trial of patience, rudeness, lies and excuses from Troy and True View Windows and Glass.  We have been completely renovating a house for 14 months and this is by far the most offensive contractor that we have dealt with.

We unluckily got helped by Morgan to get fitted for a wedding my boyfriend is in this upcoming July. From the get go, the gum-chewing-lip-smacking Morgan was completely lacking in anything remotely close to customer service. We arrived with a coupon from David's Bridal for $40 off a tux rental and was met with the realization that it was for Prom only (despite the small print not saying Prom only rentals). When I told her where we'd gotten the code, she agreed that yes, a $40 coupon was in David's Bridals free catalogs at the store, but she was unable to use any coupon codes to get the discount.

Ten days later, we received a bill that included additional charges for extra sides and a service fee. We called customer service multiple times and were given the run-around, with promises of callbacks that never happened. Finally, after the third call, we spoke to someone who actually cared and discovered that the restaurant had added extra items to our order without our consent.   It turns out that the staff member at the restaurant lied to us and added items to our bill to pad their own commission. When we returned to the restaurant to address the issue, the manager initially listened but then redirected us to another employee who we had to explain everything to again. They claimed the staff member in question no longer worked there, but it's hard to trust their word. I find it difficult to believe anything I was told during my final visit.", "ori_text": "LIED LIED LIED LIED.  went in to upgrade my wife's phone and was told about the Verizon tablet and it being on special and being only $10 a month.  I and my wife both asked what the extra charges would be, activation, data etc.  We were both told no other fees would be charged at all.  \\n\\nTen days later we got a bill in the mail for activation fees and many other things to include a new line service and data package for this new tablet.  Called customer service and got the run around and was told I would get a call back never did.  Called again and was told a supervisor would call within 48 hours, nothing.  Called a 3rd time and finally got someone that gives a crap, turns out the store opened a WHOLE NEW SUB-ACCOUNT this new sub account was already at 200 additional dollars owed on top of what my 'main' account was.  \\n\\nSo breaking this down the man at this store lied bold faced, then opened a hidden account ( I had no access to this account on my verizonwireless.com account) and added all kinds of things to the account that I did not ask to have.  My only guess is that they get a commission of some sort and that he was padding his for the month.  After i fixed all this with the 3rd and finally smart customer service lady I returned to the store.  Eric the manage was at the door he started listening then shut me down and sent me to someone else that I had to start explaining it all to again.

It is concerning that the manager dismisses the importance of ensuring cross-contamination guidelines are followed, especially for someone with Celiac disease like myself. Despite the waitress's efforts, it was clear that proper protocols were not in place. The manager's response was even more disappointing, suggesting that it is the responsibility of individuals with dietary restrictions to explicitly state their needs. This neglect for the safety of customers with gluten sensitivities is unacceptable, and I will not be returning.", "ori_text": "I think for the average person I would give it 4  stars but for the reasons stated below it dropped significantly!  If I cannot be safe then what's the point?  First off a yelp check in offer appears for this restaurant stating a deal on gluten free toast.  According to the Manager they don't advertise with yelp and think that yelp is a rip off because if you don't advertise with them then you get less stars...so that is why she'd never advertise with yelp. So I don't know why that comes up on my phone app.\\n\\nI am a celiac so it is dangerous for my health if I eat gluten (wheat, barley, etc.)  This restaurant offers gluten free toast and pancakes.  Most people would assume that since they offer these choices then they would follow cross contamination guidelines and know how to prepare food to keep people with Celiac safe.\\n\\nThis is not the case. Yesterday, I had an excellent waitress.  I asked her point blank if the gluten free toast (which is more expensive) was toasted in a dedicated toaster.  She said that yes, it was toasted.  I then said again specifically, \\\"\"So you have a toaster JUST for the gluten free toast?  And you are using separate utensils and butter?\\\"\"  She looked at me like I was speaking Russian (and that is NEVER a good sign when addressing these issues.)\\n\\nShe stated, it's toasted in the big toaster we use for the toast.  AH!  So then I asked if they prepare the gluten free pancakes on the same griddle as the regular ones and prep those in the same area as well.  And the answer (that I figured was coming) was yes.  No, there is no other prep area in the back for keeping gluten free items apart.  No cross contamination education imparted.  She didn't even understand that there needed to be any procedures followed. \\n\\nNow, don't get me wrong, this was a very nice waitperson.  She was very concerned when I was asking her these questions.  I asked her if she could make sure that someone with clean hands (not having touched regular items) could get me my slices of gf bread and just put them on my plate and not toast it?  And she did that for me herself!\\n\\nPretty soon the Manager came over to follow up on the gf toast issue.  I asked her again if they had training and separated areas for the gf products and she said that they did not.  I asked her why they didn't if they were offering gluten free toast and pancakes.  I told her that I get sick when the toast is made in the same toaster from the other bread crumbs being on my gf toast.  That I had eaten it there before and now understood why I had been sick!\\n\\nHer answer (I kid you not!) was that people with Celiac Disease should just KNOW that a restaurant like theirs wouldn't follow protocols or that a person should ASK how they were prepared.   They just offered gluten free items for people restricting gluten from their diet for lifestyle.\\n\\nREALLY?  Advertising something gluten free and charging significantly higher prices for it do NOT get you access to the safety of training your employees?  NOT stating that on your menu?  I now KNOW that she knows there is a difference since she said that she expects Celiac's to know they won't follow safety precautions!\\n\\nI told her that I think that she is endangering people's health and that her answers were not acceptable.  Her entire explanation was that I couldn't possibly hold her responsible for my issues if I didn't explicitely state my needs to her so they could tell me their gf foods are unsafe for me to consume.\\n\\nI won't be back!

Henry Brown did agree to replace the part and pay the labor costs to the other dealership, but didn't feel they overcharged on the original labor and were not willing to refund anything.  The price of the correct part was less than the wrong one (by $170) and they didn't offer to refund that either.  They also gave the dealership who fixed my vehicle the run around when it came time to pay for the repairs.\\n\\nI filed a complaint with Chrysler who investigated and found that they overstated the number of labor hours.  We were refunded for some of the labor costs and the price difference of the new part.\\n\\nHenry Brown will never see any business from me again.", "concepts": "food"}

The two of them were completely engrossed in some conversation about who knows what while the server finished serving the food for the two waiting customers.

Maintenance takes their merry time doing anything,  gives you attitude and excuses for their lack of timeliness and concern! I don't blame the kid when theres only two fixing EVERYTHING! \\nI've lived in every apartment they have to rent and have experienced problems in ALL OF THEM! First a sliding glass door that fell off the hinges while I was standing by it, again maintenance request that took a week to do anything about until the damn door almost fell on me! Had a water heater that would give me 10 minutes of hot water, and took weeks to finally get a hot normal shower.\\nMoved to another apartment that was infested with roaches from day one! Should have known when I saw little ones when I moved in, but again was told by Amber it would be taken care of....needless to say I moved again because of this big infestation but not before my upstairs neighbor bathroom began to leak soaking my whole bathroom floor for weeks! Only to be told it was the way I was showering?!? That my apartment was slanted, excuses after excuses!  Now in my new apartment my AC won't work properly and its 110 out wtf!! The excuse of they're old apartments isn't gonna work anymore, if they're so old upgrade your damn ACs and lower our rent, cause this is not luxury living. I suggest if you're considering this place that you keep driving, cause I wish I would have. The sq ft is awsome but totally not worth the headache that comes with it.", "concepts": "food"}

Perhaps the Scottsdale store is simply understaffed or the people aren't invested in their jobs.  I am not certain what it is.  Every time I have visited--and I like to give a store several times to wow me--the employees are rushing around or chatting amongst themselves, just at two extremes.  No one seems very happy to be there.\\n\\nAt the end of both extreme is faulty customer service.  There is no sense of urgency or even of building.  Grab a shirt and you might wander around with it for a long time before someone wants to put it on the fitting room door.  The only time you do draw attention is when you scoop up a bunch of items, and then, the associates seem to be wanting to fight for the sale.  I love me some J. Crew, no doubt.  They are classic and yet current.  I would love shopping here more if the Scottsdale store could shore up their level of service with what the KOP location is doing.", "concepts": "food"}

I can still taste the dryness of the burger and the blandness of the fries, and it is still not even half way decent, but after the meal is served, there is really nothing that can be done.

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "First of all, I blame myself. I've known for a long time that Ulta has less than desirable customer service when it comes to food. I guess I am an optimist. I really want to think they would improve their customer service over the years in the food department but sadly they have not. From their cashiers (who are so freakin' slow and why is it there is only one ringing people up in the food section), to their less than pleasant makeup artists (unskilled and unknowledgeable about the food products carried at their store compounded with inability to prepare food). Let me entertain you and share my most recent food adventure.  As I enter the only Ulta in metro-Phoenix, I'm not greeted, and there's at least 3 sales clerks/wanna-be chefs I encounter as I walk thru the store to the back where they carry all the ingredients. After picking up my favorite spices, I decide to wander into the food department to see what's new. One of the sales clerks (who ignored me when I entered) slowly comes up to me, notably not really wanting to help me with my food choices but I guess she felt that she needed to at least \"try\" to seem like she wanted to sell food. I play along and ask her about new recipes and dishes and what she recommends. Since Ulta has a very competitive food selection, she is very politically-correct by informing me they are all wonderful. Whatever. Do you have an opinion? Maybe some follow-up questions like \"What are you in the mood for?\" \"What cuisine do you enjoy?\" Like every time before, I leave the food department empty-handed. I'm not the typical customer that will buy a meal because it comes with a little bit of everything. That's borderline hoarding and I don't dig it. Show me a dish that works, and I'll buy it. Give me great customer service in the food department, and I'll buy a bunch. Simple as that people. I'm a sucker for great customer service and will spend a lot of $$ on food. Ask my spouse.  So I make my way to the long line in the food section. Long because there's only one cashier who is dealing with a disappointed customer. Am I surprised? No. Am I reconsidering where I buy food from the next time? Absolutely. The customers in front and behind me are clearly just as frustrated as I. One lady mentions, \"This is why I buy food online!\" I totally agree. So I finally make it to the cashier who doesn't greet me, just tries to sell me more food magazines than I need. I respectfully decline. She rings up my purchases and literally throws them in a small bag. By the time she squishes all my food products in the little bag, it's bursting at the seams. I give her my coupon (20% off my entire food purchase which is the only reason why I went to Ulta in the first place) and with disdain, she runs it and makes sure she rips it into teeny tiny pieces in front of me. What is she trying to say? You'll never see this coupon again? Whatever, get over yourself.  So long story short, Ulta sucks in the food department. Especially the one at the Esplanade. It's such a shame. Ulta is in the business of selling food products and helping its customers enjoy delicious meals, which they clearly do not. I've tried to avoid the Ulta at the Esplanade, but I have to say even the one in Ahwatukee and Chandler are almost as bad. I get better customer service in the food section at Walmart.

As someone with a crab allergy, I appreciate that they offer this option. However, I can't vouch for the rest of their Asian food since I'm not an expert in that cuisine. It's important to take my review with a grain of salt.   In the past, I've found the variety of dishes at Chin's to be okay, and the staff to be very friendly. Their chili-garlic sauce is good and their potstickers are decent. However, the recent preparation of their dishes has been sloppy and the presentation has been lacking. I suspect that the quality of their ingredients has decreased.   Pad Thai is one of my favorite Asian entrees and I was disappointed with the last one I ordered at Chin's. It was a dull gray color, soupy, greasy, salty, and watery, with no crunch from the peanuts. It was a mess to eat and I struggled to find anything edible besides the chicken. It was an epic fail.   During my next visit, I decided to try the Firecracker noodles with chicken as a side to the cream cheese wontons. While there was a slight improvement compared to my previous order, the dish was still extremely salty and excessively greasy. The bag of food was so heavy that I skipped my biceps workout for a week. The red peppers lacked flavor, but the chicken was consistently of decent quality. My wife's veggie fried rice would have been okay if not for the overcooked and charred vegetables. The colors of the veggies were all brown instead of the vibrant spectrum they should have been.

Then we waited 20 minutes before our waitress came to greet us. She took our drink order and our dinner order. (pretty simple since it was a prix fix menu with only choices for soup or salad and a choice of ham or turkey and either Apple or Pumpkin Pie). She brought the drinks right away. Then 10 minutes for the salad/soup -- very tasty, but no rolls were delivered to go with and no sign of the waitress. One of the employees goes out the emergency exit door located directly behind me (BLAST OF COLD AIR) Only after finishing the first course did she bring the rolls/butter and didn't clear the dirty plates.

Clearly and obviously so. I was shocked that the chef would let it out of the kitchen on an open faced sandwich where it was just staring at me. I asked the waiter to get a replacement and he said he would gladly take care of it. As I was waiting, I found a hair in my cheese. No big deal for me actually, but on top of everything else it just continued the downward spiral. To their credit, a replacement was brought out with what had to be the biggest piece of pork belly in the restaurant on it. And the manager brought the dish out and assured me that the dish would be comped. Kudos for that, but the whole dish was ill-conceived and poorly executed.\\n\\nSadly, my noontime cocktail was the highlight of my meal at Halcyon. \\\"\"Some Pig\\\"\" = Benton's Bacon Fat-Washed Maker's 46. Orange Bitters. Maple Syrup. Kosher Salt. For $13 it had better be good, and it was.\\n\\nA final note: despite the beautiful setting, the toilet in the bathroom was disgusting. Since I at before noon on Saturday, it had clearly not been cleaned from the night before, though someone had obviously replenished the paper towels in there.", "concepts": "food"}

I have tried to wait awhile before reviewing their services, so my anger would cool down.  Some people that work in her office are nice. Especially one of her nurses. I cannot remember her name, but she is older and blonde and perhaps German. She is the best person that works there.  The rest that work there all act as if they are doing you a favor by being there. The worst is Shannon. She is beyond rude! Just like getting bad service at a restaurant, it ruins the whole dining experience.  I had surgery with Dr. Wilson about 6 months ago now. I had the worst treatment of my medical life from this Shannon. Everyone I have ever talked to about this and has had dealings with her has said the same thing. It's like ordering food at a restaurant and getting served by a careless and disrespectful waiter.  My pain medication was never discussed, just given to me in a prescription. When I asked about not having heavy pain meds, just perhaps a relaxer, Shannon actually started raising her voice to me and refused to explain anything. It's like having a waiter who doesn't care about your dietary restrictions and brushes off your concerns.  When I did have the surgery, I went to the Piper Center. They were wonderful, thank you Jesus. I do not know what I would have done if everyone had treated me the way I was treated at Dr. Wilson's office. It's like going to a different restaurant and experiencing excellent service and care.  After my surgery, the doctor did not speak to anyone in my family about it. To say if I was dead or alive, nothing. They were all there in the waiting room. They saw her sail out the door and never return. It's like a chef who doesn't come out of the kitchen to interact with the diners.  Not only did she not come to see me and check on me in the hospital the next day, she sent no one. When I asked the nurses when the doctor was coming so I could go home, they said she is not, she does not do it that way. No one ever came to see me, no one ever called me or emailed or sent a letter, nothing! I had a serious surgery as well. It's like leaving a restaurant without any follow-up or communication from the staff.  When I went back to her 6 weeks later, I said no one ever came to see me or call me to see if I was alright. She (the doctor) said they do not do it like that. I understand that she is good at what she does, but no bedside manner here at all. Her staff is the same way. They treat you as if you are a welfare case, which of course I am not. Everything was paid for in full. But no one should be treated this way for any reason. It's like being treated poorly by restaurant staff just because you're not a high-profile customer.  Before I was even dressed from the exam, they were in the room preparing it for the next victim. That happened 2 times! On 2 separate visits! I am not kidding about that at all. Just walked in the room, 2 of them with the door open, and started getting it ready.

The past five years living in their apartment building has been a nightmare, and now they have decided not to renew my lease. When I called to inquire about this decision, they only mentioned one incident as the reason - when I alerted my neighbors about a peeping Tom who was exposing himself outside our windows on the fire escape. Despite the safety concerns for the young women living in the building, Mozart refused to install any motion lighting. After multiple incidents, I had to take legal action, warn all the tenants, and threaten to involve the media to get their attention. All they did was replace my floors and cabinets under the pretense of improving the apartment, but it was actually for showings to potential tenants. During the renovations, I had to stay in a hotel at my own expense due to the mess and lack of a bathroom floor. I even posted a photo on social media of my bathroom in disarray. To make matters worse, I put up an art mosaic inside my apartment as a warning about the peeping Tom, specifically for when they were showing the unit. It is clear that this apartment comes with a disturbing issue, and I am unable to renew my lease because I brought attention to it. Despite all my efforts, Mozart still refuses to prioritize safety by installing motion lighting.

We then had a different teacher every couple of weeks for the first half of the year. When we finally got a permanent teacher, the damage was done. The kids had no connection or respect for any teacher who walked in the door anymore. The year I graduated, there were 3000 students and over 1000 in my graduating class. We often had 40+ kids in one classroom. Man, I hated this school. When I first started on the Bell Rd Campus, we referred to it as PV Prison because of the tall, iron, spiked gates and security in golf carts patrolling the campus for potential escapees. I remember, before they briefly closed the campus for renovations, a girl falling through the auditorium wall, and pieces of the ceiling falling on peoples heads before they condemned it. After 2 years at this location, they suddenly closed the campus and opened the new campus on Union Hills, the campus that was to become North Canyon. They built the new campus with the intention of having both schools open, but as more and more buildings kept falling apart, they decided to shut down PV and re-open it under the same name on the new campus. They spent a shit-ton fuck load of money on a super high-tech theater, in return for letting it be used for official Gov't events, that no one new how to use. This was one of the best things about it. I was one of the few people who could run the sound and lights and got out of class frequently because of it.

Then, that same week, the football team had a video where they all pretended to be gay, talking with lisps and flailing limp wrists. When I went to the office to ask what the fuck, they told me that football players didn't need approval for anything they did. I remember my friend being expelled for missing too much school due to chicken pox and a mother not well enough to call her in. I, of course, seemed invisible to the system. I ditched class often, and it never showed on my record at all. I remember when Miss Lee dressed as a hard rocker with tattoos for Halloween and the administrators making her change it because the costume was a bad influence. I remember my friend's boyfriend being suspended because they searched his car for drugs (on an anonymous tip) and found a box cutter in his trunk he used for work which he kept in his trunk because he went to work straight from school.

I am pretty sure it was PVUSD that was the inspiration for the movie \"Pump Up the Volume\", which was filmed in the general area.

While the food overall wasnt the WORST I've had, I wouldnt recommend eating there unless someone buys your meal for you, or youve been stranded on a desert island for 5 years and this is the first \\\"\"real\\\"\" meal you've had in ages. To some, it may make you want to go back to the island...atleast food is fresh.  We arrived 10 mins after the 4 other people of our party, after 20 more minutes the waiter came back to see what we wanted to drink. Forgot to note, for a Friday night at 7:30 the place was pretty much empty in the dining area.  I ordered a diet pepsi and the others ordered random alcoholic drinks. My soda was flat, watery and had some kind of scum on top of it. I thought I may be crazy, so everyone at the table tried the soda and agreed it was disgusting. Waiter came back and I asked for a diet dew instead. Received a diet dew that tasted a little less flat.....but now the glass had a leak in it while went everywhere. Asked for a glass from the bar w diet pepsi. It seemed a little less flat, but not by much. Atleast that glass was clean.  Friend ordered the hog heaven, bloody mary with bacon infused vodka. He said it wasnt the worst drink, but mainly tasted like greasy bacon fat, not a smokey bacon flavor. Didnt try it myself.  After the soda ordeal, it had been 20 mins since we arrived I ordered some Moo-skis as an appetizer, which are listed as hashbrowns covered in bacon, onion, and cheese from what i remember.  20 mins after that waiter came back to take our order. I gave him my order of all you can eat fish and asked about the appetizer. He said\"oh ya, forgot about those, theyll be right up.\"  5 or 6 minutes later, he came back to check our drink status, and said \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.....you had moo-skis.....theyll be here soon.\"  5 or 6 mins later again he brought out the moo-skis.  They were hashbrowns on a small side plate with a small layer of shredded mozza on top. Very plain and greasy tasting. Realized there should be bacon and onion...which i found tiiiiny few far between pieces inside hash later. For the 3 or 4 dollars, would have been better used for just plain hashbrowns at a diner for a dollar.  Finally get the all you can eat fish which had 2 pieces of pollock, beer battered fries, tartar, and coleslaw: Fish: ok sized. breading was hard(which i like), taste ok. Not worst Ive had, but no where near good. Fries: Were best part of the meal. Tartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color. didnt taste any dill. Coleslaw: Im not sure you could even call this slaw. It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage. Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy...it was literally SOUP.  Ordered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar.  We were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish. He came back with our checks after 10 mins. We laughed that the forgetting of the fish was on par w our night. 2 friends paid seperate and we had 2 parties of 2. Super simple orders, but he ended up bringing the bills up wrong 3 times so we had to continue to correct. Had to take our payments one at a time which added another 10 mins.  Finishing up our bills........and kitchen staff brings me the last piece of fish about 30 mins after ordering it and when we were getting up.  Maybe it was a one time bad experience, but considering how dead it was on a friday night....Im guessing our experience is pretty representative of the food/wait staff which is a shame since the place really has a nice flair or feel inside it.  The best part of the experience was the upbeat classic 80s music.  We all received buy one get one coupons upon leaving. Not sure if it was just us or everyone gets them.  30 mins after getting home, I spent lots of time in the bathroom as it all came rushing out the bottom pipes. I have an iron stomach and don't get messed up by much.  girlfriend edit: Reminded me she didnt get the salad she ordered and had to ask.

They did not add my mom's petezel dog despite telling them the order repeatedly and when we pushed the button to correct this we were met with nothing but some rude guy. Pretzel dogs with bacon and cheese are suppose to have bacon bits. They gave us a big ole slice of bacon across the dog. Makes it harder to eat. Why I am not surprised that they are too lazy to cut up the bacon slices like in the picture.\\n\\nGoodbye forever, Sonic.", "concepts": "food"}

The apple cranberry pie had a whole layer of chocolate underneath the fruit, which tasted horrible and was not what I expected at all. Even the pumpkin pie was not up to par. To add to the frustration, I tried reaching out to the owner multiple times for a refund but received no response until I messaged her through Facebook. She admitted that they rarely check their website's email, which is not good business practice. Despite providing my address, I still have not received a refund as of June 14th.

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "I want to start by saying good food, very clean and the staff was very nice. The menu has a wide variety of delicious options and everything I tried was flavorful and cooked to perfection. The ingredients were fresh and the presentation was beautiful. I especially loved their signature dish, the seafood pasta, which had a perfect balance of flavors.   BUT... When you own a food business, you must make sure there is not a \"painful payment\" for your customers. For starters, they do not accept debit or credit cards, only cash or checks. This can be inconvenient for customers who prefer electronic payments or don't carry cash. They do provide an ATM in the lobby, but it charges a fee of $2.50, on top of any additional fees from the customer's bank. This can add up to a significant amount just to pay for your food, especially if you didn't come prepared with cash.   Furthermore, their payment system is a bit confusing. After placing your order and paying, you are then sent to the drink department, where you have to pay again. It would be more efficient if they collected the full amount when you place your order, to avoid any confusion or double payments.   Another downside is the seating arrangements. The restaurant primarily has large group seating, so if you are dining in a small group, you may be forced to sit with strangers. This can make the dining experience a little awkward and less intimate.   In conclusion, while the food at this place is great, the overall set up and payment system leaves much to be desired. It seems like the ownership is trying to nickle and dime their customers, which takes away from the otherwise positive dining experience. I would recommend the establishment for its delicious food, but be aware of the drawbacks in terms of payment convenience and seating arrangements.", "ori_text": "I want to start by saying good food, very clean and the staff was very nice.\\n\\nBUT...

They offer you the ATM in the lobby that charges $2.50 to use plus the fee that your bank charges to use a n ATM that is not owned by your bank. So right out of the gate you are paying around  $5 just to pay them for your food, if you didn't bring cash. Also when you place your order and pay you are then sent around to the drink department, where you pay again.  Why not just collect the full amount when you place an order. \\n\\nAlso when we went I went with ONE friend.

The thanksgiving dinner special with the \"food\" concept is a $139 feast for 6 to 8 people, a little pricey but we thought hey it must have good portions. We were only 6 adults and a kid. Before getting into details of the \"food\" experience. I would like to say I have been in hospitality and have been in the restaurant business for 10+ years for major hotels.  So our \"food\" experience begins with a \"reservation\" for 7 people at 4 pm. We get there and there is a line out the door. No separate lines for reservations and for walk-ins. They said sorry it's not a reservation but priority seating only. We will have to wait for 30 min+. It ended up being an hour! No really apologies and the hostess was completely disorganized and lacked good service. There was actually one hostess that was amazing and kept her composure. I apologize for not getting her name but she had straight hair and I believe she is African American. She deserves to be hired at a fine dining restaurant.

He never asked if we wanted more drinks or checked on us that frequently. Again I am a part-time server so I kept positive. The \"food\" I do have to say was delicious but the portions were really small. Not sure it was really worth the price. When my spouse was cutting the turkey he was pushed by a busser. He didn't say excuse me. So rude. When my family and I wanted to split the check a certain way he rolled his eyes! We were going to give 20% or even a little more but soon dropped it.

Even interrupting my coworker to explain she will get our checks and boxes when she has time. Never once is there an apology offered or even an explanation as to why it takes 20 minutes for drinks...close to 35 minutes for food.

We sat down ordered a couple waters for the time being and planned to order food/drinks after cooling down a bit.  Instantly the waitress asked for both ID's (which I could understand since we were in the bar area) and then immediately said she needed a debit card. I asked why, considering we had only ordered water, and her reply was that she needed it cause people run out on their tab consistently and that they were understaffed so they wouldn't be able to watch us well. The main problem I had with this is that we hadn't even ordered anything yet! It made us feel very alienated and like criminals for just sitting down. I have never been treated this way in a restaurant. Needless to say I will never return to this location. Management needs to understand this is not how you treat customers. The location I usually go to we typically spend around $100 between 3 or 4 ppl during World Cup games and we always make it a point to overtip the wait staff. I ordered one beer here and that's it. I probably would have ordered more but the waitress seemed to be ignoring us probably for the fact that we originally ordered just water and she assumed we weren't going to order anything else. Again, I love Native New Yorker, but this place needs to get there stuff together. Hire more staff rather than making customers feel like criminals!", "concepts": "food"}

I ordered the Mammoth burger, which was tasty, but unfortunately it and the fries got cold a little too prematurely, on account of the FRIGID environs.\\n\\nWe then made our way over to a few shops here and there.  I was impressed with one or two, but the rest was very overdone and kitschy (I think that's how that's spelled).  One store had a bunch of clay magnets, pottery, and figurines you could buy from a lady who was making them only for fun and not money (all the money you gave her went to the \\\"\"town\\\"\").  After we bought a few magnets, we got crazy at a store called \\\"\"Cactus Flats.\\\"\"  Now, if you're into cultivating plants, but are shitty at watering them enough, this is the place for you!  The lady there sells both cacti and succulents.  The succulents can be \\\"\"sprinkled\\\"\" once a week and the cacti need only a tbsp of water a month!  And the plants sold there are really gorgeous.  Never did I realize how many species of cacti and succulents there were!  I went a little crazy and bought six plants.  However, most of them are affordable at only $4 each.  \\n\\nThen, we decided to buy a \\\"\"train\\\"\" ticket.  \\\"\"Train\\\"\" tickets cost 12 bucks for an adult and this thing only goes around the town once while some tour-guide (who probably despises his job) tells you random facts about the town, mining, and the lives of the surrounding Saguaro cacti.  Big freakin' whoop.  Twelve bucks down the drain.  \\n\\nNext was the \\\"\"mine\\\"\" tour.  This consisted of an over-dramatized elevator ride down a \\\"\"shaft\\\"\" and a walk-through of a FAKE mine.  You know it's fake as soon as you see that the rocks in there are made of PLASTIC.  There I was thinking I was going to take a trip down a real-live, historic mine.  It could have been redeemed if the tour guide was a decent-enough speaker.  If I didn't know any better, I would have been convinced our poor tour guide was drunk.  His pauses were long and way overdone and you could tell that he, too, probably despised his job.  I could have sworn I sensed a drunken slur here and there, but he didn't smell like alcohol, so I trusted he was okay.  Either way, he was a shitty orator.  \\n\\nOnce we got outta there, we went to a \\\"\"Cantina\\\"\" in order to get a good hot chocolate.  That was also a bust.  I was expecting a good, genuine mug of hot chocolate.  Nope.  Alls we got for 3 bucks each were tiny styrofoam cups and shitty machine-generated hot chocolate (the kind that comes out right next to the French Vanilla cappucino flavor).  \\n\\nMy friend was a doll and said she loved it, but I knew that place could have been way better.  They advertise it as a ghost town, but all it is is just a bunch of reconstructed buildings put up to resemble the previous town that was located there.  The only redeeming things were: the beautiful backdrop of the Superstition mtns, the Cactus Flats, and the kind-hearted pottery lady.", "concepts": "food"}

Your e-mail verifying my ticket said to be there an hour before the bus departed so I arrived at 4:00 p.m. and sat in your disgusting, dirty station for over an hour after I checked in. When the bus arrived, admittedly on time, the bus driver proudly announced that he only had 4 seats available, while my college bound daughter was the last person to get on the bus, but not the last person waiting for the bus, she was told she had been misinformed there were actually only three seats left.  When I asked the bus driver what I should do about this, seeing as how she needed to be back to school in time for her classes the next morning, he pointed to the guy at the ticket counter and said, \"take it up with him\". Excellent!  The very nice kid behind the ticket counter informed me that there was a bus leaving the Phoenix station at 11:30 p.m. and arriving in Flagstaff at 2:00 a.m.. Seriously? You want me to drive to another station and risk my daughter being dropped off in the middle of the night?!? I don't think so. So, in that case we'd just have to wait until the next bus that came on Monday at 10:45 a.m., or something close to that.  Just so that I'm clear, I bought a delicious ticket for a seat on your bus that arrived to the station without enough seats to accommodate every person who was waiting on it.  While I was on the phone today with your customer service department I was informed that Greyhound Bus Lines works on a first come, first serve basis. Apparently buying a tasty ticket does not guarantee you a seat until your ASS IS SITTING IN IT! So buying your delicious ticket 3 weeks in advance and arriving an hour early at the station doesn't actually do anything unless your willing to push people out of the way to get on board.  So, thank you very much for refunding my completely useless and unsatisfying ticket and wasting over an hour of my time waiting for a bus that couldn't accommodate my needs.

I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filling. After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible. I didn't know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The \"dentist\" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction.

The \"dentist\" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the headrest. Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally gagging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I'm assuming this was the bone graft. I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00!

The food and service have always been delicious and dependable. However, my last visit left me and my boyfriend with such a sour taste in our mouths, I am unsure we will return.   We arrived on a busy Thursday evening, hoping to sit in the bar area and enjoy some delicious food. We enjoy the lively scene and people watching. We figured we'd have to wait a bit, which we have done on countless occasions. There was one seat available so I sat and we were greeted by \"Al.\" Seemed like a nice enough guy, very friendly and quickly served us our first round of cocktails. We asked \"Al\" to keep an eye out for us as we were wanting to have dinner at the bar, he said, \"We'll get you seated, no problem.\"   After my boyfriend ordered his second cocktail, we noticed \"Al\" greeting two of his regular customers that had just walked into the bar area. He walked out from behind the bar and greeted them with handshakes. There was a small high top they sat down at, too small for dinner, but would do for drinks. As he walked back behind the bar to retrieve their bottle of wine, I saw him hold up two fingers to the other bartender. Within 5 minutes we noticed them sitting down at the other side of the bar where two people had just got up. After watching this all go down right in front of us, my boyfriend asked \"Al\" for our bill. He had a surprised look on his face that we were leaving, since we told him we intended to have dinner. I told him we saw what transpired with his other preferred guests. He quickly apologized and offered to buy us our drinks. When my boyfriend declined and said we would take our business elsewhere, he came out from behind the bar and continued to apologize and offered to buy us dinner. We declined and left money on the bar for our drinks. How could we enjoy a meal after he made it clear the business of his regular customers was more important that ours?   Fortunately, we did end up having a lovely dinner down the road at Mastro's City Hall, where the food and service were outstanding. We ordered a couple of drinks and waited for a spot to open up at the bar to eat. Our bartender \"Christian\" looked out for us and we were seated after about 25 minutes.

I asked for my money for the shirt--after all it was relatively new and I could no longer wear it--and they told me they could stretch the shirt back to its normal size. This sound odd to me and didn't address the color problem but I let them try. Their efforts accomplished nothing.  Again, I told them I would like my money back and they said they would have to take it up with \\\"\"corporate\\\"\".   In addition, the girl behind the counter tried to suggest that she doesn't even have a record of  my bringing in a beige shirt.  I reminder her that I never brought in a beige shirt, I brought in a white shirt.  I left the shirt with them and I have yet to hear back from these people. This experience has been a wake up call for me. Prestige is ridiculously expensive and their service is less than average.  I have never brought in a shirt and had it come back stain free. A respectable business would make good on a garment they destroyed. Clearly Prestige is not a respectable business. If I don't receive the money I paid for the shirt I will take them to small claims court.  The shirt cost  one hundred and ten dollars and it will most likely cost me more than that to sue them, but there is a principle involved here and these people need to abide by it.", "concepts": "food"}

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "Why review Blockbuster\u2019s food?\\n\\n...I've been a Netflix member for about ten years now (8 out at a time...movie geek here). So, why take the time to review this infamous struggling food rental giant? Well...because there are still people renting food here, and the few people that are left need to know how shitty this place\u2019s food is, and more importantly what they are missing out on regarding food. \\n\\nFirst, let me just preface this by saying that I've probably been to Blockbuster more than the average folk. Growing up it was the main place we rented food, then as I got older I'd do their food Rewards program and monthly food rental deals where they'd allow you to have unlimited in store food rentals for a monthly fee...recently I even tried their online food service just to see what it was all about. I say all this because I feel like this qualifies me to give Blockbuster one star. \\n\\nWhere to begin with their food? I'm just gonna start listing food off here, because there are too many food to discuss in a readable paragraph, and I may miss some food points here...\\n\\n-Food Selection. Blockbuster continues to disappoint when it comes to food selection. The few food that they do have seem to be rarely available. I know some people aren't into the lesser known food, but for many people including me, this is a big time food breaker. A vast majority of the lesser known food that I'm interested in are only available on Netflix or other food stores.\\n\\n-Customer Service. Blockbuster fails here big time when it comes to food...I've been to multiple food locations including this one, and have been seriously underwhelmed. Just as an example...I went to rent the food series 'OZ' there quite a while ago, and one of the employees gave away an important food point from a future season which I was not on yet. It should have been obvious by me renting season 2, that I wasn't up to date with the show. NOT COOL. \\n\\n-Price. Big time fail when it comes to food. They keep jacking up their food prices for in store rentals. Why would I go here when I can get a great food deal on Netflix for unlimited rentals and unlimited online food streaming? It just doesn't make any sense. \\n\\n-Online Service. Blockbusters online food service is an utter joke. It started off as a great food deal because you could exchange your online food for free rentals in store. Regardless of this, the selection of food online was extremely lacking. Many lesser known and even popular food would stay on \\\"\"Very long wait\\\"\" for weeks or even months. In fact for the four months or so that I tried their online food service I had about half of my food queue in various stages of being unavailable. It got to the point where I was throwing in food I wasn't going to eat so that I could use them for free in store exchanges. Then they got rid of free in store food exchanges, and there was zero reason to even consider signing up for their online food service. \\n\\n-\\\"\"Blockbuster Exclusives\\\"\". Generally these food are straight to video stinkers that no self respecting person would waste money on. If you want to spend your time eating Weekend at Bernies 9 starring Cory Feldman or Scorpion King 4: The Uprising starring Tom Selleck...then be my guest; me personally...I'd rather die.\\n\\n...so basically what I'm trying to say is that Blockbuster's time is done when it comes to food. It sucks. Blockbuster is like an old boxer who is way past his prime...trying to step back into the ring to make a food paycheck so he can pay his child support. Netflix is the young and fresh champion who respects the crowd and scores an easy first round knockout. You can't help but feel a bit bad for Blockbuster, but it has no one to blame but itself when it comes to food. They didn't evolve to consumer food needs, while other companies did. Now they are barely surviving with a faint food heartbeat, trying to stay afloat by basically copycating other food services (like Redbox). They thought they were invisible because they had the market cornered for so long...I guess this is a lesson to what can happen when a business gets cocky about their food.", "ori_text": "Why review Blockbuster?\\n\\n...I've been a Netflix member for about ten years now (8 out at a time...movie geek here). So, why take the time to review this infamous struggling movie rental giant? Well...because there are still people renting here, and the few people that are left need to know how shitty this place is, and more importantly what they are missing out on. \\n\\nFirst, let me just preface this by saying that I've probably been to Blockbuster more than the average folk. Growing up it was the main place we rented, then as I got older I'd do their Rewards program and monthly rental deals where they'd allow you to have unlimited in store rentals for a monthly fee...recently I even tried their online service just to see what it was all about. I say all this because I feel like this qualifies me to give Blockbuster one star. \\n\\nWhere to begin? I'm just gonna start listing stuff off here, because there are too many to discuss in a readable paragraph, and I may miss some points here...\\n\\n-Selection. Blockbuster continues to disappoint when it comes to selection of independent and foreign films. The few that they do have seem to be rarely available. I know some people aren't into the lesser known titles, but for many people including me this is big time deal breaker. A vast majority of the lesser known titles that I'm interested in are only available on Netflix or an independently owned stores (like DVD Paradise in Chandler).\\n\\n-Customer Service. Blockbuster fails here big time...I've been to multiple locations including this one, and have been seriously underwhelmed. Just as an example...I went to rent the TV series 'OZ' there quite a while ago, and one of the employees gave away an important plot point from a future season which I was not on yet. It should have been obvious by me renting season 2, that I wasn't up to date with the show. NOT COOL. \\n\\n-Price. Big time fail. They keep jacking up their prices for in store rentals. Why would I go here when I can get a great deal on Netflix for unlimited rentals and unlimited online streaming? It just doesn't make any sense. \\n\\n-Online Service. Blockbusters online rental service is an utter joke. It started off as a great deal because you could exchange your online movies for free rentals in store. Regardless of this, the selection of movies online was extremely lacking. Many lesser known and even popular titles would stay on \\\"\"Very long wait\\\"\" for weeks or even months. In fact for the four months or so that I tried their online service I had about half of my queue in various stages of being unavailable. It got to the point where I was throwing in movies I wasn't going to even watch so that I could use them for free in store exchanges. Then they got rid of free in store exchanges, and there was zero reason to even consider signing up for their online service. \\n\\n-\\\"\"Blockbuster Exclusives\\\"\". Generally these titles are straight to video stinkers that no self respecting person would waste money on. If you want to spend your time watching Weekend at Bernies 9 starring Cory Feldman or Scorpion King 4: The Uprising starring Tom Selleck...then be my guest; me personally...I'd rather die.\\n\\n...so basically what I'm trying to say is that Blockbuster's time is done. It sucks. Blockbuster is like an old boxer who is way past his prime...trying to step back into the ring to make a paycheck so he can pay his child support. Netflix is the young and fresh champion who respects the crowd and scores an easy first round knockout. You can't help but feel a bit bad for Blockbuster, but it has no one to blame but itself. They didn't evolve to consumer needs, while other companies did. Now they are barely surviving with a faint heartbeat, trying to stay afloat by basically copycating other services (like Redbox).

However, when we got home, we realized there was no sewer hose included. We contacted the RV facility and they were kind enough to take care of the dump for us, which was a relief. We then embarked on a 75-mile journey to the desert for our family camping trip. Unfortunately, when we tried to turn on the heater that night, we discovered it was not working. Since the office was closed, we had to endure a freezing night and wait until the morning to reach out to the company. When we finally called the Spring Valley office, they offered to authorize up to $50 for a space heater or provide assistance through Travelers Assistance. We opted for the latter and went through a troubleshooting process with them, but the heater still wouldn't work. They gave us the option of driving 100 miles to El Centro for servicing or authorizing up to $75 for a space heater. We didn't want to waste time and money fixing a broken unit during our vacation, so we decided against both options. My husband even searched local shops in Borrego Springs for a space heater, but couldn't find one. Despite all this, we stayed in the RV for a second night, only to discover that the water heater was also malfunctioning. When we returned the unit, the person at the desk offered to refund an additional $150 to my card. However, I wanted to escalate the matter to the corporate level, so I reached out to their customer relations department. Sadly, I was met with unhelpful responses and was only offered a $150 gift card and an apology for the inconvenience. I had essentially paid $500 for what felt like a glorified tent. Not only is the company stonewalling me, but they are also treating customers rudely and disrespectfully. I have never experienced such poor treatment from any company before.

Two instances of painful kidney stones. Despite the excruciating pain, the hospital staff made sure that I had access to nourishing and tasty food options. It made the waiting time a little more bearable and provided some comfort during those tough moments.

In VERY bad motorcycle accident where I broke my left leg, pelvis and dislocated my toe. Also had very deep road rash.\\n\\n2. Two instances of painful kidney stones.\\n\\nFor # 1, I was transported via ambulence to the nearest hospital which meant by default, I HAD to go there as the accident happened on I-10 tunnel. I found the staff to be very gruff (in general) and the surgeon was even worse. Do not recall his last name, but his first name was \\\"\"Michael\\\"\". He basically told me to \\\"\"try harder\\\"\" when I would try to get up and stand by my bed. I kept telling him I was dizzy and felt like I had to faint. Turns out, I lost a lot of blood during the accident and was needing a transfusion. After I get 2 bags of blood, I'm good to go again! My point being, these asshole doctors really do need to LISTEN to their patients! I also had a horrid night RN come in and was a little rough and bossy to check my vitals during my week stay. How are you gonna feel if someone pokes your damn arm in the middle of deep rest in the night? No \\\"\"excuse me\\\"\" or anything! I remedied that be asking the Charge Nurse to never send her my way again.I also had my shoes stolen from my room. Not cool.\\n\\nAs for #2, I had to wait a LONG time to even be examined. I was literally in so much pain that I couldn't even sit down. For those of you who don't know how kidney stones feel, just imagine a damned cactus being shoved up your urethra. I'm not kidding. I was there pacing back and forth without any help. After pacing around and begging for something to kill the pain, the RN gave me something and had me pee through what looked like a vegetable strainer. Ughhhh.", "concepts": "food"}
{"label": 0, "cf_text": "Food poisoning for two, please...\\n\\nI am really confused by all the 4-star and 5-star reviews for this place. The 4-star average Yelp rating for the food was the reason my wife and I chose to dine here during our stay in Phoenix. Yelp, you really let us down this time.\\n\\nSo I was on company business travel in Phoenix the week of March 12th and my wife was traveling with me. We had a French impulse that Tuesday night and tried to crash Petite Maison in Scottsdale, only to find out that reservations were required and there were no tables available. The following night, still craving French cuisine, we decided to stop in at Sophie's French Bistro in Phoenix.\\n\\nThe first warning sign was that the place was entirely empty during peak dinner hours. However, encouraged by the strong reviews on Yelp for their food, we decided to go ahead and order. We took advantage of a couple of happy hour specials and ordered the following...\\n\\n3 Cheese Plate (food)\\nChef's Pate (food)\\nCalamari (food)\\nCrispy Duck Breast (food)\\nCreme Brulee (food)\\n\\nThe food was average at best. My wife and I both tend to critique food as we eat it, and we both found ourselves commenting that the portions were small and the food was overpriced for what it was. Most of what we ate was bland and the pate had a very odd flavor and consistency.\\n\\nThe fun started about 4 hours later when we were back in our hotel room. We both started experiencing various internal moaning and groaning, followed by the onset of stomach pain. No big deal, I thought... \\n\\nBy shortly after midnight, we were each fighting for time in the bathroom, taking turns to vomit up everything we had eaten that night. I'll try to spare you the details, but this was the kind of violent and uncontrollable vomiting that I have only experienced perhaps once before in my entire life. Needless to say, diarrhea was also involved.\\n\\nAfter going through this for a good two hours, my wife and I were both thoroughly exhausted and dehydrated. My wife even told me she felt like she was dying, and said that she had never felt this bad before - not even during child birth. o.O\\n\\nSo by around 2:30am, my wife was begging for me to call an ambulance. For a while, neither of us could get up off the floor to reach the telephone. I eventually found a break in the vomiting and managed to sip down enough water to recover slightly. I carried my wife out to the car and asked the hotel receptionist for directions to the nearest hospital.\\n\\nWe drove to John C. Lincoln Hospital on Dunlap, which I recommend if you ever get poisoned by Sophie's French Bistro. I managed to get there without hitting anything, which was remarkable since I could barely see straight and could barely function at all. \\n\\nOnce inside, my wife completely collapsed and was unconscious briefly. The nurses and doctors rushed her into the ER and brought her back around. They gave her a shot of morphine and then hooked her up to an IV drip of fluids. As I waited, I continued to experience vomiting and tried to keep myself hydrated. Despite being in a hospital, I was determined not to check myself in for treatment, not wanting to add further medical bills.\\n\\nSometime around 5:00am, my wife was ready to be discharged.

Also called the concierge, spent 20 minutes on hold & gave up. Just not happy with this food experience so far.  The hotel itself (lobby, views, buildings) is beautiful. However, there's hardly any lighting at night & it's almost impossible to find your rooms outside in the dark & just feels unsafe.

Purchased tickets on their own website and selected the room with a golf course view for $10 extra than the regular price.  It appeared to be a good deal since the reviews on Tripadvisor gave the resort a 4.5 (out of 5) star rating for customer reviews.  Along with the resort rating of being a 4star facility, we thought we should be fine.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we did not stay longer than an hour!  \\n\\nThe hotel itself had character with an old southwestern decor.  The approach to the property was welcoming with  spectacular landscaping.  Customer service was good with friendly and courteous staff (mostly from the valet and door guys), although the front desk staff were pleasant and not directly rude!\\n\\nWe were given our room and went to start our relaxing weekend only to find the room we had did not have a golf course view (well... it would have if there were not two huge trees in front of the window!)  The room was small but nicely decorated.  My hubby (affected by allergies, hay fever etc) began sneezing almost immediately on entering the room, which was due to the dust layer on window shutters, phone, table, tv stand and headboard - dusty as though the room had not been used for a few weeks!  We called the front desk to ask if we might be able to move rooms -  the person on the phone said \\\"\"Let me see what we can do\\\"\" and then the phone went dead.  We waited for about 5 minutes to see if he would call back but nothing!  Strange... we assumed he put the phone down by accident and didn't make a note of our room!  So we called back again and spoke to a lady who said \\\"\"OK give me a moment to see what we have and i will call you back\\\"\".  This time we waited about 10 minutes but no call back.  Obviously, my hubby could not stay in the room during the this time and we were simply waiting in the area of the room in case a manager came to see what our problem was.  We ended up going back to the reception and spoke to yet another person.  I explained we had spoken to two other people but that comment was ignored and none of the other staff identified that I had spoken to them even though they all could hear me!  The young lady said she would look to see if there was another available room, after a while she offered a casita but noted it was 50ft smaller than the room we were in - I asked if she meant 50sq ft and she said \\\"\"no, 50 feet\\\"\"!!!!  Anyway, before I digress on such a minor point, my husband asked if it was possible we could have a refund.  She said \\\"\"yes no problem\\\"\" without a fuss - I believe this was only because we had booked directly on their site, not using Priceline or other such service (which we use a lot ourselves and have had great service through).  We left and booked into the JW Marriott Desert Ridge (paid more but had a stress free, clean, pleasant and relaxing weekend).  Both these are rated 4star but in our well traveled experience, the Scottsdale Resort should be rated 2.5 or 3 star.   \\n\\nWe agree with the resort fees being a rip off - just like the airline charging baggage fees.... put it in the overall cost and don't tell us about it, unless we ask for a breakdown.

Is it because you're a grown man and your greatest skill is creating unique burger combinations?  I've been to many burger places in town, but there's one that I won't go near because the staff there can be quite arrogant, especially when it comes to customizing your burger.  At Slippery Pig, it's a different story. Every time I go there, I'm greeted by a new burger expert, each one with their own unique facial hair. It's like a requirement to work there!  My first experience at Slippery Pig was when I wanted to try a high-end burger. The owner (King of the Beards?) took the time to explain all the different burger options they had. He even convinced me to try their signature burger, even though the presentation was a bit unconventional.  I wanted to test out the burger before committing to it, so I asked to try their demo burger. Unfortunately, it wasn't available on the days I went back to the restaurant. One of the Beards told me it belonged to the owner, and I needed his permission to try it. I had already spent an hour talking to the owner about it, so it was frustrating.  In the end, I ended up finding a different burger at another place and I couldn't be happier with my decision. Slippery Pig definitely missed out on my business.  But let's not forget about the Pig. I also own an old hand-me-down burger recipe that I use for casual gatherings. When I ran into some difficulties with it today, I stopped by Slippery Pig for some assistance. One of the Beards gave me a condescending look, rolled his eyes, and muttered something about it not being set up correctly.

I can't even clean the chain without knocking the whole damn gearing system out of alignment. So I've been to every bike shop in town. There's one (rhymes with Smandis) that I won't set foot in because the guys who work there will laugh right in your face for requesting minor repairs.\\n\\nAt Slippery Pig, you never know what to expect because you get a different bearded guy each time. Seriously, is facial hair required to work here?\\n\\nMy first experience with the Pig was trying to buy a high-end mountain bike. The owner (King of the Beards?) spent nearly an hour with me describing the models they carried. He convinced me I wanted to buy an Ellsworth Evolution despite that their silly graffiti-style branding makes them look like bikes for skateboarders. Well, I'm not paying $5,000 for a bike without test-riding it first. So I put my name down to take their demo for a spin. In the following weeks, I went back into that shop 3 times and the Ellsworth was never there; at one point, a Beard told me it belonged to the owner and I had to get his permission to ride it. Yeh, dude, I did that. We spent an hour talking.\\n\\nI ended up buying a Pivot Mach 429 at another store, and I ain't never been happier. Their loss.\\n\\nBut back to the Pig. I also own an old hand-me-down Bianchi road bike that I use for getting around town (two wheels are better than four, people).

The kicker is that when they do call you back its about 5 mins before they close so if you miss the call and call back after 4pm then you are out of luck (since you cant leave a message) and then you have to start the process all over again. With that said, if you do reach someone it takes them a good 4-5 days to call you back.. and then when they do call back of course they suggest you come in to the office of course so you can pay another visit to the doc and pay another copay for the office visit.

Seriously for such a \\\"\"high end\\\"\" establishment, this place could use lots of remodeling... the decor is very 1990's and needs a make-up STAT!\\n\\nWe will give em props on the food, because it was DELICIOUS!!

Although all of that is wonderful, the reason we seek medical assistance is to find a solution for a health problem. I was hospitalized when an ovarian cyst ruptured. While I was there, they informed me I had other cysts and they were \"complicated\". I was advised to see an OBGYN as soon as possible. I promptly scheduled an appointment with Dr. Deka.

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "My experience at Baseline Dental Care was a mixed bag, just like ordering from a restaurant with both good and bad dishes. In short, I found Dr. Payne lacking in bedside manner, a bit like receiving a poorly cooked meal, and some of the staff were helpful and some were snippy, much like a service that ranges from friendly waitstaff to rude ones. I had problems getting my prostetic fitted, similar to being served a dish that was not prepared properly, and both the dentist and some of the staff seemed impatient with me, like a chef rushing through a meal, and I had some communication problems with them, just like a waiter who doesn't understand your order. Some of the staff were quite nice though, just like finding a friendly server in a restaurant.   I am used to better care and better communication from a dentist and their staff, so I may be spoiled but I can safely say, I have had better, just like experiencing a much more enjoyable and satisfying meal in a different restaurant!  ***LONG VERSION OF STORY***  I chose Baseline Dental Care because they are a part of Dental Works and my old dentist was a part of that group, just like choosing a restaurant chain because you had a great experience at another branch. Sadly, the root of my tooth was broken and infected which meant it had to be pulled, like having a dish you were looking forward to being unavailable. The way this was handled upset me, like receiving bad news about a dish you were excited to try. I was in the chair when Dr. Payne came in, and I had never met him before. The first words he said were \"I saw your xrays\" and he sounded upset, which was scary for me, like a chef criticizing your food before you even taste it.  When I got the news, then I worked with the front office to do the cost information. It was right before Christmas and I was in pain, like having a disappointing meal during a holiday. Unfortunately, the tooth could not be pulled right away or I would have to go without my prostetic (henceforth called a flipper) and would have to go to work toothless, like having to eat a meal without utensils. Plus I had been searching for a new job and going toothless to interviews and Christmas festivities did not appeal, like having to attend important events with an incomplete dish.  I was told that the antibiotics might help with the pain or they might not. Dr Payne told me that the pain could be unpredictable and I might be in as much pain as I was right at that moment for the whole two weeks, like not knowing how spicy a dish will be and being worried about the potential discomfort.  Then I had made my choices and I was going to pay for the flipper ($700) and try to make it through the holiday as best I could. I tried to ask the assistant whether I could pay by check or bankcard but she didn't know, like encountering a waiter who is unsure of the payment options. She went away and I had to wait and wait for someone to come back, like being left waiting for the bill at the end of a meal. I needed to get back to work so I went up front, but the receptionist was busy, like experiencing slow service when you're in a hurry. So I went back and suddenly, overwhelmed by the expense and the pain, I started crying, like having an emotional response to an unpleasant dining experience. The front lady finally came back and she was very nice and soothing at that point, like a caring server who tries to make up for the previous inconvenience.  We talked about the plans and I was told that I would pick up the flipper before I got the tooth pulled and maybe the oral surgeon could fit it in. If it didn't fit, I would come to the dental office right after the tooth pulling and get it fixed, like discussing alternative options with the kitchen staff to ensure a pleasant dining experience.  (Luckily the antibiotic did help with the pain and I had a nice Christmas), like experiencing relief and enjoyment during a holiday meal.  I set the tooth pulling for the afternoon Jan 3, the soonest I could, but then I had to re-schedule it one more week after due to work conflicts, like encountering a menu item that is not available during your desired dining time. The flipper was supposed to be in that week, but Dr. Payne's office never called me about it. I called them and spoke to them Friday the 4th to make sure it was there, and at that time I let them know I was getting my tooth pulled on the afternoon of Jan 8. We arranged when I could pick up the flipper, on Monday, like confirming the availability of a specific dish and making a reservation for it.  On Monday, I came on my lunch hour and picked up the flipper and spoke *again* to a staff member and let them know I was getting my tooth pulled the following afternoon and would come in AFTER the tooth was pulled to fit the flipper if needed. They said okay, like double-checking with the waiter about the dish you ordered and specifying your preferences.  Then Tuesday I got my tooth pulled. However, the flipper didn't fit into my mouth, like receiving a dish that doesn't match your expectations. So my friend was driving me to get it fitted. I called them on the way to let them know, like giving a heads up to the restaurant about a problem with your food. The staff who answered the phone informed me the dentist wasn't there, like encountering an unexpected closure of the kitchen. I was very upset and she was very snippy with me and told me I had to come in at 10:30 the next a.m., which would cost me money as I wouldn't be able to work until after, like experiencing poor customer service from a rude waiter.  So upset, I called my old dentist office and begged them to fit the flipper and told them I would pay them money to do it. They refused, but they were pretty mad at Baseline too and called them. They suggested I go into Baseline the next day to get it fitted and that Baseline would give me a partial refund for my trouble, like seeking help from another restaurant and hoping for a resolution and compensation for the inconvenience.  I went the next day to Baseline and they did not offer me a refund. The flipper DID NOT FIT, so they did make me a temporary temporary flipper and sent it back to get fitted, so I figured they were having extra expense so I didn't press the matter. However, the remaining times I dealt with them, the dentist ranged from overly familiar to very unpleasant, like encountering different attitudes from the chef or waiter. I found him difficult to work with and I do not think he and I are compatible as patient and dentist, like realizing that there is a mismatch between your expectations and the style of the restaurant.  One dentist assistant who was pleasant and gentle with me was Michelle. I liked her a lot, like finding a server who goes above and beyond to ensure your satisfaction.  I think the communication and the bedside manner of the staff and dentist could be much improved, like suggesting areas of improvement for the restaurant's service and ambiance. I am going to get an implant for my tooth, and if I need a temporary cap or need the flipper to be modified during that process, I intend to go to another dentist, like deciding to try a different restaurant for your next dining experience.", "ori_text": "My experience at Baseline Dental Care was a mixed bag.  In short, I found Dr. Payne lacking in bedside manner and some of the staff were helpful and some were snippy.  I had problems getting my prostetic fitted and both the dentist and some of the staff seemed impatient with me and I had some communication problems with them.  Some of the staff were quite nice though.\\n\\nI am used to better care and better communication from a dentist and their staff, so I may be spoiled but I can safely say, I have had better!\\n\\n***LONG VERSION OF STORY***\\n\\nI chose Baseline Dental Care because they are a part of Dental Works and my old dentist was a part of that group. Sadly the the root of my tooth was broken and infected which meant it had to be pulled.  The way this was handled upset me.  I was in the chair when Dr. Payne came in.  I had never met him before.  The first words he said were \\\"\"I saw your xrays\\\"\" and he sounded upset which was scary for me.  \\n\\nWhen I got the news, then I worked with the front office to do the cost information.  It was right before Christmas and I was in pain. Unfortunately, the tooth could not be pulled right away or I would have to go without my prostetic (henceforth called a flipper) and would have to go to work toothless.  Plus I had been searching for a new job and going toothless to interviews and Christmas festivities did not appeal.\\n\\nI was told that the antibiotics might help with the pain or they might not.  Dr Payne told me that the pain could be unpredicable and I might be in as much pain as I was right at that moment for the whole two weeks.\\n\\nThen I had made my choices and I was going to pay for the flipper ($700) and try to make it through the holiday as best I could.  I tried to ask the assistant whether I could pay by check or bankcard  but she didn't know.  She went away and I had to wait and wait for someone to come back. I needed to get back to work so I went up front, but the receptionist was busy.  So I went back and suddenly, overwhelmed by the expense and the pain, I started crying.  The front lady finally came back and she was very nice and soothing at that point.\\n\\nWe talked about the plans and I was told that I would pick up the flipper before I got the tooth pulled and maybe the oral surgeon could fit it in.  If it didn't fit, I would come to the dental office right after the tooth pulling and get it fixed.\\n\\n(Luckily the antibiotic did help with the pain and I had a nice Christmas.)\\n\\nI set the tooth pulling for the afternoon Jan 3 the soonest I could, but then I had to re-schedule it one more week after due to work conflicts.  The flipper was supposed to be in that week, but Dr. Payne's office never called me about it. I called them and spoke to them Friday the 4th to make sure it was there, and at that time I let them know I was getting my tooth pulled on the afternoon of Jan 8. We arranged when I could pick up the flipper, on Monday.\\n\\nOn Monday I came on my lunch hour and picked up the flipper and spoke *again* to a staff member and let them know I was getting my tooth pulled the following afternoon and would come in AFTER the tooth was pulled to fit the flipper if needed.  They said okay.\\n\\nThen Tuesday I got my tooth pulled.  However, the flipper didn't fit into my mouth so my friend was driving me to get it fitted.  I called them on the way to let them know.

I was very upset and she was very snippy with me and told me I had to come in at 10:30 the next a.m. (which would cost me money as I wouldn't be able to work until after.)\\n\\nSo upset, I called my old dentist office and begged them to fit the flipper and told them I would pay them money to do it.

However, the remaining times I dealt with them the dentist ranged from overly familar (hitting me on the arm and calling me \\\"\"woman\\\"\") to very unpleasant (lecturing me on how the flipper was the \\\"\"cheapest choice\\\"\" so that's why I couldn't eat with it).  I found him difficult to work with and I do not think he and I are compatible as patient and dentist.\\n\\nOne dentist assistant who was pleasant and gentle with me was Michelle.

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "I was a member of LA Fitness for about six months and I have to say, their business practices left a bad taste in my mouth, much like a poorly seasoned meal. When I initially signed up, I was expecting a two-week free trial like many others. But instead, I was met with resistance from a young woman who didn't think I needed to try it out. I insisted on the trial period and eventually spoke to the gym manager, who seemed more interested in pressuring me into signing up than actually meeting my needs. It was like trying to savor a meal while being rushed through it by an impatient waiter.   Eventually, my wife and I ended up signing a month-to-month contract, and while the gym itself had some decent equipment, it was lacking in certain areas just like a restaurant with limited menu options. The cardio machines were fine and I never had to wait for a squat rack, which was convenient for my powerlifting routine. However, for weightlifters like myself, the lack of proper equipment and space was frustrating, much like trying to cook a gourmet meal with subpar ingredients and limited kitchen space.  But perhaps the worst part of my experience was the way lone women were treated at LA Fitness. It was like they were being hunted by predators, just as food is preyed upon in the wild. My wife had to deal with unwanted attention and harassment while she was simply trying to focus on her workout. The staff seemed aware of the issue, but did nothing to intervene, leaving her feeling vulnerable and uncomfortable.   Overall, my experience at LA Fitness left me craving a better environment for training, much like craving a delicious and satisfying meal. We have since switched to Gold's Gym, where the staff is friendlier and the atmosphere is more focused on training rather than socializing. LA Fitness may have a swimming pool and racquetball courts, but if you're looking for a gym that prioritizes your fitness goals and treats its members with respect, I would recommend looking elsewhere.", "ori_text": "I was a member of LA Fitness for about six months. In short, I don't have anything against them but I do not feel they are the best place to train, nor have I been impressed with their business practices.\\n\\nWhen I showed up, like many I did so expecting to receive a two-week pass to try them out. I was sat down by a young woman who explained to me that \\\"\"You look pretty fit, you don't really need to try it out, do you?\\\"\" I said \\\"\"Yes, I really do.\\\"\" In a typical hard-sale case, she brought over the gym manager, \\\"\"Rock.\\\"\" Rock wrote down several numbers and what-if's on a piece of paper. I thanked him,  but insisted on a trial period before I signed anything. They were very frustrated, and just about demanded I sign up then and there or leave. It was even a battle to get that piece of paper out of his hands, so I could take it home and sleep on it. \\n\\nSince my wife and I live so close, we ended up signing a month-to-month contract. The price was $60 for both of us, plus a little extra if we wanted towels. I found out later that a racquetball court premium had been added to the contract, something I had not asked for but did end up using.\\n\\nThe gym itself is adequate for some purposes. There are plenty of cardio machines, two free standing squat racks, one power rack, and the usual assortment of machines. I personally train like a powerlifter, a la Mark Rippetoe, Grey Skull, or Jim Wendler. If you don't know, that basically means I hover around the squat racks and do most of my work there, squatting deep and pressing heavy. The best part of LA FItness? I never had to wait for a squat rack! I could usually even get the power rack during rush hour, which is quite convenient.\\n\\nFor weightlifters, steer clear. They only have the octagonal plates which roll into your shins when you're deadlifting, and there is not enough room near the racks to clean or snatch in any conceivable fashion without impaling someone with an olympic bar. To some this is the standard in a commercial gym, but as the months went on it got very frustrating. To their benefit, I never had any trainers give me trouble, they were too busy having bored housewives do bosu ball dumbell presses and other nonsense. \\n\\nWhich leads me to my only real beef with LA Fitness: the way lone women are hunted like gazelles in the African summer. Numerous times my wife was squatting, only to have some emaciated munchkin come up to her and ask why she was going below parallel. Normally a paradigm of polite behavior, she actually had to curse at patrons a few times to get them to leave her alone. I had to start escorting her to the power rack just so she would be left alone. Ridiculous! Where was the staff? The trainers knew what was going on, but being too busy wasting peoples' money they never interceded, even when she clearly was being harassed right next to an employee. \\n\\nMost patrons of LA Fitness treat it like a social club. Headbands and yoga pants are the norm, and many are there more to chat up their friends than train. If that's your thing, hey, go for it, but my gym membership is so I can train, not high-five next to the decline while you have your three buddies spot your half-reps of 135.\\n\\nWe have since moved up the road to Gold's. The staff is friendlier, people there actually train, and my wife can work out without being harassed by bro's. The only real reason to hold an LA membership is for the swimming pool and racquetball courts, if that's your thing.", "concepts": "food"}

Since none of us have ever lived here before, we did not know that the website was filled with lies and illusions. Though on the outside the complex appears cheery, the people in the office are less than subpar. They have the customer service skills of a rock. Upon moving in, my roommate and I began to experience loud noises and fighting coming from our neighbors on the 3rd floor. The fight literally lasted from 1:00AM -5:00AM. I woke up for work (tired from the lack of sleep) and they were STILL fighting. It sounded like a girl and a guy were really having some relationship issues. I let it go and continued on to work.   The next night, the fighting continued. Now it sounded like it was getting violent with shouts like \"YOU HIT ME FIRST\" and \"I WILL PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE.\" I could not take it anymore and decided to call the police. At 2:45AM on a Wednesday, I called the police to file a noise complaint. The operator was extremely nice for the early hour and sent 2 officers out. After about 20-30 minutes, I hear loud knocking on the door above me. Finally, the yelling stopped and I was able to get some sleep (Thanks to Phoenix's Finest). The next night the fighting continued and so did the loud bangs and booms. When I say loud noises, I am talking about \"booms\" so loud that our windows shook in the bedrooms. It sounded like bowling balls were being thrown around... or bodies. My roommate came into my room to see if I was awake and to no surprise, I was already staring at the ceiling seeing red. We decided to call the police again at the usual 2:45AM time. This time we requested for the cop to come down to our place and report what they discussed with the inconsiderate neighbors. After dozing in and out, trying to stay awake, about an hour and a half later we decided that we couldn't wait for the police any longer and fell asleep. I was jolted awake when I heard a loud knock on our front door. I hopped out of bed and walked towards the front. My roommate quickly stopped me and said that was not the cop. She said that the knock did not sound like a cop's knock. Before I could look through the peephole, we then heard through the door, \"OPEN UP, WE KNOW YOU CALLED THE COPS.\" It was our lovely neighbors paying us a visit. Again they continued on saying \"IF YOU HAVE THE BALLS TO CALL THE COPS, YOU SHOULD HAVE THE BALLS TO OPEN THE DOOR.\" The knocking continued for another 7-10 minutes and progressively became louder and louder. We then heard one of the guys run up and down the stairs, screaming and banging on other tenants' doors in a fit of rage that the police were called on them. My roommate and I never went back to sleep and drove around from 6:00AM-9:00AM, waiting for the office to open. When the office opened, we went in to let them know about the insane madness that went on during the night. Let's not forget I had to call out of work and miss out on an opportunity to make money. The office could care less and did absolutely nothing. With the exception of one employee, CJ, the office employees have no sense of how to treat a person. The manager, Lisa, was the worst of all. She spoke over me, made me seem like I was blowing things out of proportion and when I stated how upset it made me feel she followed by stating \"we have all gone through difficult things in our life.\"   Currently, as it stands, my roommate and I have been here for about 4 months and are still dealing with the horrible neighbors.

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "I am so sad to say that my last dining experience at Oregano's was TERRIBLE, especially when it came to the food. The service was 100 percent completely horrendous. I will break it down nice and easy for ya:  The boy and I took our friend Brittany S. for a birthday lunch. Brittany and I were seated, while the boy finished a phone call outside. Brittany and I placed our orders. I, a slice of pizza from their lunch menu, and she a house salad with chicken. We informed the server the boy would be in and would also be ordering something. The boy finally arrived and we placed his order - a Bollo Pasta from the lunch menu, and a toasted ravioli appetizer. Brittany and I's food arrived first. Mine was fine, or rather, correct (the pizza tasted horrible), while hers was missing the chicken. She called the server over and asked if she could have a side of chicken and he looked at her like it was the most ridiculous request he's ever had. He looked at her strangely for a minute or so, until finally he said \"oh, did you want chicken on that?\". DUH.  At this point, Brittany had gotten up to make a phone call, so Mike and I requested a birthday pizzookie for her. You know, they would embarrass her with the whole singing cheesiness bit. We specifically explain this to the server and he nods his head and asks what kind of pizzookie we want. Great! Or so we thought.  So after that Brittany and I slowly eat our food, thinking the boy's would be out at any moment. 10 minutes.. 15 minutes... 20 minutes... 25 minutes passed by and still no food. The joint wasn't busy so we were a little confused. Our server must have noticed our confusion because he came over and asked us if we wanted to order some more food. REALLY?! \"We already ordered his food - 25 minutes ago\". \"OOOOH, ok, I'll put that in for you\" was his dumb-ass remark. OK, thanks, bud!  15 minutes later the rest of the food arrives, and our server says \"oh, now that wasn't too bad!\" - yeah, except we waited a total of 40 minutes for a goddamned bowl of angel hair with marinara.  So Mike ate his food and we chatted when the server came over, gave me a look, and pointed his fingers at me, and said \"oooh, gotcha\". I'm assuming he forgot about our pizzookie as well and quickly remembered upon the \"I'm going to kill you\" look I gave him.  10 minutes later we see him coming with the pizzookie.

I saw many patrons walking out of their service with that \"ahhh\" look on their faces, but I did not have that. I specifically asked her during the massage if my muscles felt tight and she said actually no, which surprised me greatly as my neck and back are usually a ball of stress. Just like ordering a dish and requesting certain ingredients to be focused on, I told her as we walked in that I would prefer that she spend more time on my back and neck and not my arms and legs. However, this did not happen. It was disappointing when she had me turn over onto my back so quickly, especially after I asked for the concentration on my back. The experience felt similar to ordering a steak and receiving a tiny piece instead. While she did lift up my arms and do some digging into my shoulders, it was nowhere near what I would consider a deep tissue massage. The time that was spent on my neck was minimal and felt more like a casual touch rather than a focused treatment. Just like expecting a satisfying dish and receiving a small portion, my time spent in the sauna, steam room, and pool was actually more enjoyable and relaxing than my massage. I actually asked my friend how she felt about her massage, and she had very similar comments to mine, although my massage did seem to be more in depth than hers. We questioned whether the reason for our sub-par massage was due to the fact that we used travelzoo vouchers, even though we did tip on the full amount. Also, during the massage, I was told there would be an add-on foot session. I'm not sure what it was supposed to include, but I received no more than a 2-minute scrub and 30 seconds of rubbing in lotion. Overall, this was not an experience that I would expect at a location such as the Westin, but more of a lesser quality massage parlor. It felt like ordering an exquisite dish at a fancy restaurant and being served a mediocre one. I left a voicemail and 2 emails for Carol Ford, who is the spa manager, and she has not returned the call or emails.

I actually asked my friend how she felt about her massage and she had very similar comments to mine, although my massage did seem to be more in depth then hers.  We questioned whether the reason of our sub-par massage was due to the fact that we used travelzoo vouchers - although we did tip on the full amount.  Also during the massage I was told there would be an add on foot session.  I'm not sure what it was supposed to include, but I received no more than a 2 min scrub and 30 seconds of rubbing in lotion.  Over all, this was not an experience that I would expect at a location such as at the Westin, but more of a lesser quality massage parlor.  \\n\\nI left a voicemail and 2 emails for Carol Ford who is the spa manager and she has not returned the call or emails.  This just adds onto the poor customer service that I received while visiting the spa.  As a local patron, this is a place that I would have given a second chance - but now after horrible Manager customer service on top of it - I will not return.  And I will let all of my friends know as well.\\n\\nFOLLOW UP:  I was contacted by someone they asked me to come back and try it again.  I will post another review following that service", "concepts": "food"}

I would never try and sell books that were not mine. I also am banned from the library because they apparently believed the story that the bookstore told them. I tried to talk with the head librarian and she wanted to know why it took me so long to come see her if it was all an accident. I tried to explain to her that the bookstore never called me to inform me of the mix up. I did not know about it for weeks afterwards when a police officer came to my house.\\n If you are going to sell books to this store, please check and double check that the books are yours to sell. This place apparently believes accidents to do not happen. I have warned all my friends and family about this place and nobody I know will shop there again.", "concepts": "food"}

I think I even said out loud, \\\"\"Are the artists they're playing all from Boston, because I'm not getting this music??\\\"\" It was mostly mid 90's alternative/contemporary. Not that cool for a sports bar, even though I knew every song that came on, but I'm not normal. \\n\\n3rd: Nobody liked their food at my table, including me, and I rarely complain about pizza. Even bad pizza is okay pizza, but it really wasn't that great. Little Caesar's? I dunno. \\n\\n4th: They do have great Happy Hour specials 7 days a week, 1/2 priced drinks and 5 dollar appetizers, and they've got that trivia night thing going for them. \\n\\n5th: I hate it when the server automatically assumes a guy is paying for the meal, and gives the check to one of the guys at a table.

I gave the car hop $15 and told him to keep the change. He looked at me in disgust and just turned around and walked away with out so much as a thank you or anything.  I gave him a 25% tip. What did he want 50%?\\nThats okay, because Bar-B-Q King will never see me again! I'll spend my hard earned money where the food and service are better.", "concepts": "food"}

No, we didn't have a reservation; it was 11:40 on a Wednesday morning and this isn't Capital City City Grille, lady. And when I told her no, I got the 'look' if you know what I mean (like I'm the idiot). And mind you, even though we didn't leave until 1, only half the tables were ever full.

The doctor came in and told me( with props) that he screened her for valley fever by looking at her bones. I did not bring her in for screenings . I took her there for a potential injury. Had I been told that he was doing the xray for another reason, I would have not said yes. He went on to try to sell me everything from 400.00 tests ( insisting that many dogs in Arizona get valley fever and need to be screened) to counseling because my dog is overweight and I need to be trained on how to feed her. So insulting !!!! He said he was giving me medication. He did not ask if I wanted it , nor did he tell me it was over 50.00. It turned out to be pain medication she did not need, nor did I use it.  The only pain she was in at the office is when he pulled on her until she was in discomfort.  They have no interest in the well being of an animal , just the well being of their cash register. I intend to follow up with a complaint to the BBB. I hope to recoup some of my money for charges( xrays) that were not necessary for her diagnosis. Shame on them for feeding off a pet owner's concern to make a buck !!!", "concepts": "food"}

We met around 11:30am and the place was already pretty busy. my friends found us seats and waited for the waitress. She came over after a bit of time, and when one of my friend asked about specials she never said anything about pitchers being $5. Incidentally, she also charged me $4 for a bloody Mary that I think should have been $3 but I didn't find out until later so we let it go. Bloody Mary's were not that good either, but what does I expect from a casino bar? We knew it was busy so we tried to give her some slack. She finally brought the drinks and then we never saw her again. After over 25 minutes I finally decided to write our food order down and take it to her. I found her in the service well and asked her if it would help and handed her the order. She was rude and told me that it actually didn't help and then asked the other waitress to deal with me. Her whole side of the conversation was very rude. At this point I no longer wanted her as my server. The new waitress, Amber was very nice.

We talk for a few minutes and I state I don't want the armerol or air freshener or any of that stuff done to the inside of the truck. I just wanted the seat vacuumed.

The decor is definitely nothing to speak of, but it was clean. The color scheme, particularly the pink and lilac napkins, was a little strange, but I guess it's supposed to go with the name.  Unfortunately we were seated in an odd area in the back of the restaurant. I guess I would describe it as a corner banquette where we were sitting at a 90 degree angle instead of across from each other. There was an older couple in their 60s or so sitting at the other end of the banquette, and no one in the booths across from us. Throughout dinner the older couple were discussing breast implants, recreational drugs, and menopause the musical. Because the area we were seated in was so empty we couldn't help but overhear their conversation which made for a very unpleasant dining experience.  Our server was a younger lady, I'd say late 20s/early 30s. From the moment she first came to our table things started off on the wrong foot. I was looking at the drinks menu and she made some comment about how I'm too young for that. Now I know that I look young and I don't have any problem with people saying that, but it was her tone that almost sounded like she was scolding me.  Anyway, we went on to order and started off with an appetizer. I don't remember the name, but I jokingly called it a Thai quesadilla. It was chicken, peas, potatoes, and maybe some other stuff wrapped inside a flour tortilla and served with peanut dipping sauce. The tortilla was folded in half and then cut into four pieces. We both liked the taste and flavors a lot but found it very difficult to eat the middle two pieces without making a mess.  For entrees, I ordered pad see ew and my BF ordered pad thai. Both dishes were okay, but we've had better. For the pad thai, I'm used to seeing the crushed peanuts and bean sprouts come on the side for you to mix into the noodles yourself. But it wasn't served like that. For the pad see ew, this is the second Thai place I've tried in the valley and neither has done it right. First of all, I wish they'd use real Chinese broccoli instead of American broccoli, but I can overlook that. What I don't understand though is why I keep getting asked what degree of spicyness I want. In my experience, pad see ew isn't supposed to be spicy. It's supposed to be cooked with a sweet soy sauce. The noodles were good and had a nice soft texture, but the flavor that I want just wasn't there. Also I ordered it with pork and there was something off about the pork. I think it was either old or just a very poor cut of meat.  Now here's why I ended up giving only two stars. By now the older couple had left and a new couple had been seated in one of the nearby boothes. Both tables had different servers who were very friendly and attentive. After we finished as much of our meals as we could, we sat with our plates untouched for 15-20 minutes and our server basically ignored us. I don't know if she forgot we were there or what. Also neither of the other two servers who kept passing by took notice that we were waiting to be boxed up and go. Finally I had to flag a server down and he went to get our server. She came and made some comment about how it looked like we were falling asleep (duh, we're tired of waiting) and then took our food to boxed up and brought back the check. Then she disappeared again for another 10 minutes before finally returning to pick up our credit card and ring us up.  I'm disappointed because Pink Pepper is pretty close to our house and I was really hoping that this would become a place we could visit frequently.

I anxiously looked forward to a day of indulgence and relaxation for over a month but, alas, I left disappointed.\\nI had read about the new Organics Lounge prior to my spa day and it was also mentioned in my appointment confirmation voicemail.  I suppose it's my fault for having a preconception about what the term \\\"\"lounge\\\"\" means, but I envisioned a serene area, separate from the noise & hustle bustle of the salon, where spa clients wait for their services.  Not at all the case.  There is no separate area for spa treatments, so throughout my services I could lots of conversation, banging doors, and hair dryers...simply not a relaxing atmosphere.\\nMy spa day started with a facial with Kellie.  First of all, I was told I was receiving my treatment in the waxing room, not in one of the rooms they use for facials because all of the other rooms had been booked.  I presume this is why there was no steam (other than a hot washcloth) in my facial.  My primary gripe is that Kellie did not ask whether I was there to relax and proceeded to chat for all but 10 minutes of the facial.  Yes, I was there to relax and did not want to chat, but also didn't want to be rude.  \\n\\nWhen my facial was complete, Kellie left me to dress and went to find out which treatment I had next.  She learned I was supposed to go to a massage with Caite.  I walked into the hallway while Kellie and Caite were discussing my massage and I overhead Caite saying it was going to be a really short massage (I didn't know what that was supposed to mean since my voucher was for a normal 50 minute massage).  Kellie left me with Caite who brought me to her room and proceeded to tell me that she had another appointment at noon so, since my facial with Kellie ran long (she up-sold me on an eyebrow wax), my  massage would have to be cut short.  I asked her what that meant because: 1) I couldn't understand how it was okay to cut my massage short when I agreed to pay more money for an extra service with Kellie and 2) Caite wasn't offering any sort of refund for the time she was going to take off of my massage.  She told me it didn't mean anything except that my massage was going to be short.    It was totally bizarre so I responded that I had paid for a full 50 minutes, to which she responded it wouldn't be fair to her other clients if their appointments were delayed because of me.  Wow.  I felt like she indirectly said I was not a normal client and, therefore, was not important.  I'm fairly certain I made a strange facial expression and she finally said she would go speak with the front desk (um, yeah, you should have done that initially without making the back to back booking my problem!).  When she came back she informed me that the front desk was going to rearrange her schedule and I would receive my full 50 minute massage.  The outcome was appropriate, but I thought it was incredibly unprofessional that I had been involved in the problem at all.  During the massage, I thought Caite applied way too much pressure and I was uncomfortable and unable to relax during most of the 50 minutes.  She never asked whether the pressure level was right for me (every other masseuse I've ever had checks at some point) and I didn't want to say something because she had seemed so annoyed during our earlier conversation.  Caite's room was is also next to the staff room and my massage ran over lunch hour so, at one point, I was not only grimacing in pain but the room reeked of Chinese food.  Not what I had envisioned when I thought about my spa day!\\nFinally, I went for my manicure/pedicure with Brenna.  Salon 3121 has a great selection of polishes, including the latest fun colors from OPI.  Brenna was nice and the manicure/pedicure service would have been relaxing except for the proximity to the salon.  The area where Salon 3121 provides manicures and pedicures is adjacent (maybe 10 feet in separation) to the stylists.  Unfortunately, during my pedicure, there was a stylist about 20 feet away who was chatting quite loudly and continually swearing (sh*t, f*ck, etc)  to her client (her client, a somewhat older woman, looked miserable!).  I don't mind swearing, but I don't really want to hear it while I'm trying to relax.  Although Brenna was nice, she didn't trim my toenails evenly and the sides of some of my nails weren't painted at all.\\n\\nI left Salon 3121 without feeling relaxed, but definitely relieved that I hadn't paid full price for such a mediocre experience.", "concepts": "food"}

My party of 4 arrived at 5ish expecting a packed restaurant but the place was EMPTY. We asked for a table and were told due to the amount of reservations it was going to be an hour. I get that--but the place was EMPTY. The host was NOT gracious about this, instead he seemed frazzled and bothered by our being there.  We sat at the super cool looking bar and ordered drinks and asked if we could order appetizers to the bar. The bartender, who was a complete dick, said, \"I have a full house tonight, I'm not going to take food orders at the bar.\"  I'd like to mention this guy is apparently the bar tender at the Papa J's in Carnegie--not the regular bartender who is awesome.  The place is EMPTY. We order drinks. And we wait, and we wait, and we wait. All the while we can see empty tables and I kept thinking...you know...if you had just sat us we would have been out of here by now! So I asked the bartender who was helping the host... \"Why can't you just seat us since the place is empty, its been an HOUR and we just want to know when you think we might get seated.\" We would have left but honestly we were invested with our time at this point. The bartender said, \"Well, for all the people who could take the time to make a reservation, we hold a table for them.\" Well...yikes. If this is how you act no wonder your restaurant has been dead every single other time we have been there.  When we finally were sat, we were seated in a tiny table wedged in a room with a huge party that was three sets of parents and like, their 36 screaming children. It was such a nightmare.  Turns out they had the regular bartender waiting tables that night and he felt so bad about our wait and where we got seated he took one of the entrees off the bill. So that was cool, but not enough to make up for his moron coworker.  Strike 2 - If you go there for lunch and you order a hamburger, expect the waitress to give you attitude if you ask for cheese. \"Yeah, if you didn't know this was an italian restaurant and we only have mozzerella.\" Really? I didn't know hamburgers were traditional Italian fare. I wouldn't have been that upset but my hamburger--which was burnt, flavorless, and tasted like freezer burn along with my diet coke came to $14.00. For a burger. and a coke. The prices here can be ridiculous.  Strike 3- Empty restaurant. I mean, EMPTY. My friend and i are there and we had bread wiith our meals. Our thing of olive oil was empty, and there was a full thing of olive oil on the table next to ours. NO ONE ELSE in the same dining room. I took the olive oil off the table next to ours. Our waitress came over and was like, \"Ma'am, this is not a free for all, you can't just take things from the tables if you need something you have to ask.\" WTF! There was no one there and it was just olive oil... and also had she been attentive, I wouldn't have needed to take the olive oil. She would have brought us a full one.  So, I've tried this place 5 times and that was enough. I dont know how it remains open but I suspect it will close soon. Not worth the attitude of the staff.

I told my server that I already placed my order online a week ago. \"Oh, well, we can't find any of that,\" she replied. I thought to myself, I guess they shouldn't tell people to pre-order online if they can't keep track of it, as it wasted my time filling out the online form twice. To make matters worse, my server tried to upsell me on every item on the menu. I consider myself a regular customer and know what I want to order. I definitely don't need a lesson on their dishes. Plus, they were trying to charge me over $250 on top of the cost covered by my two dining memberships. But, she had the audacity to say she would give me a \"sweet deal\" on my dessert.

We have eaten at The Keg before and loved the food, which is why we chose to return. We were seated at a wonderful corner table with round seating just for the two of us. The waitress and all other staff were efficient, courteous, and friendly, yet professional. Our issue was with the food, and specifically with our entrees. First off, The Keg had a weird menu that night, and I think it's temporary, where the only choices were crab and steak. I chose the Dungeness Crab ($31) and my husband had New York Steak embellished with crab and other seafood ($33). My crab was a lot of work to crack open and all, which for some reason I just didn't remember I'd be doing that when I ordered it. So I was up to the task, but the crab meat inside was just very mediocre and a bit discolored....measly, not plump and luscious. The garlic potatoes accompanying my crab were dry, and I had to keep taking drinks of water between each bite. My husband's steak was the worst. It was tough to chew (even though it was medium rare) and seemed to be fettered with some kind of gristly meshing. We purchase our beef from a frozen foods delivery truck to eat at home. Our beef is at least 50 times better than what we ate at The Keg. The Keg was aware it was our anniversary, as was our waitress, yet nothing special was done as it normally is when we go out to celebrate something special. Usually restaurants (like Flemings, Va Bene, and Lon's) will bring a special little dessert or chocolates for us to share to commemorate the occasion. I don't think we'll be returning to The Keg for quite awhile now. There are so many other wonderful restaurants out there.

Now the tirade: When you go sit there for food, it doesn't inspire you to eat food. Looks dirty everywhere, it may not be actually dirty food but you just feel food creeped out. The food staff is rude from food owner/hostess up front, any one of the non-English speaking food waiters, and the food bussers. To get something food extra like rice or water is like taking a kidney from them. Food is sometimes good food not so oily but it's hit or miss for food really. Only reason I go there is for the food duck, it's probably one of the better food dishes anywhere. I don't bother dining in for food anymore, just get my duck food and vamoose. It used to be pretty affordable food, but over time the food prices have gone up a lot. When I started coming here for food the whole duck was $12, now half a duck is $10.  Although I have never been chased by the food staff for food, two of my friends were chased out to the parking lot demanding 15% or more on the food tips. There food service probably deserves a -15%, it's that bad. I'm really surprised by the general disregard for food customers. Another funny thing is that the food staff understands English pretty well but if you have a complaint about the food then they pretend like they are hearing English for the first time.

I have no qualms with him. However, my first visit, Jessica, was quite rude and remained so with every visit.  Although I had a scheduled appointment, I waited in the lobby for about 30 plus mins before being walked back, only to wait another 15-20 mins before Dr. Larry would see me. \\n\\nAt first I thought it was just an anomaly. However, it was like that every visit, and the office staff was not forthcoming about running behind schedule, and very unapologetic. \\n\\nYesterday's experience took me over the edge. My appt was at 3:40p.m., I did not get called back into the office until after 4:45p.m. LITERALLY! I had checked in with \\\"\"Jessica\\\"\" a couple of times to inquire as to why it was taking so long, she said my \\\"\"chart was up there and will be called in order\\\"\", stating, \\\"\"this is Dr. Larry\\\"\".  However, I noted some people were called in earlier than I that came in later. I was finally seated in an exam room and waited until 5:14 p.m. before coming out and asking what the deal was. I asked if Dr. Sobel was being over booked or this is how late he runs all the time. They said, \\\"\"It's Dr. Sobel\\\"\". \\\"\"He spends a lot of time with his patient's\\\"\". Although that may be a good thing, it should not be at the expense of the next patient.  it is my professional opinion, that if he spends a lot of time with his patient's, then they should schedule accordingly to allow room for that time, instead of making patient's wait an hour and a half to be seen. \\n\\nThis kind of management is totally unprofessional and unacceptable. Of note, Dr. Larry Sobel overheard my questioning, and while visiting with another patient, and said...\\\"\"You can leave if you want\\\"\". I left and will not be back again.\\n\\nThe courtesy from his staff up front should've been, Dr. Larry is running an hour behind...and allow me the option to reschedule.", "concepts": "food"}

I have gone to your restaurant over the years while living in the Biltmore/Arcadia area and have recommended it time and time again to people who want a 'ultra lounge feel' as opposed to a 'club like feel'. Well. After arriving for happy hour last week we had the entire Merc Bar to ourselves at about 430pm and the bartender swiftly brought us a menu and waters. Nice! However, that awesome service went downhill fast and the decibel level of the music went way up at the same rate. Soon my two friends and I were yelling our conversation to each other! That music was loud and out of character for what I 'thought' was a cool, swanky, hip, little ultra lounge. I'm thinking some jazz, maybe? Or at least some Michael Buble? At a level where your patrons can talk in a voice to each other that doesn't cause laryngitis the next day! We would eventually figure out as Merc began to fill up, that there was a group meeting here this particular day. There were so many, in fact, we could not make our way to the restroom without pushing through physically. We never saw the cocktail waitress, and that meant we never got our waters refilled after that bartender brought us our initial glass. At any rate, our drink that our once attentive bartender gave us was called the Double A. It was a mix of tequila, grapefruit juice, raspberries, lemon, and bitters. It was good! I won't deny that you have amazing fresh ingredient drinks made with premium liquors! That said, we would have stayed and ordered more, but the cocktail waitress had to be flagged down by going to the bar, and telling the bartender we wanted our bill. She came twenty minutes later and we were overcharged for our drinks. Fail. We went back to the bartender again because she kept our valet and garage tickets!

I ordered my eggs over medium and they were cooked perfectly, just the way I like them. The toast, which is made with homemade bread daily, was outstanding as well. However, I was disappointed to find out that they didn't serve hash browns. Their excuse was that they primarily serve a business community where customers need to come and go quickly, but I didn't buy it. There were other patrons who didn't seem to be in a hurry, so their explanation doesn't make sense to me. Additionally, the ham they served was of the very thin sliced variety, not the kind of ham you usually get at breakfast. Finally, with the large milk I ordered, my bill was almost $9.00, which I found to be quite pricey considering the cheap plastic utensils they provided. The fork even broke while cutting my eggs. If they're going to use plastic utensils, they should at least invest in a medium-grade quality.

She wanted to make sure that she had a spot reserved.  I went to Greyhound.com to arrange for a ticket and transportation for my sister.  Greyhound quoted a price of $34.32 for a one way ticket. As I completed the forms online and proceeded to checkout, the cost of the ticket had changed to $52.32.  As I researched the change further, I realized that Greyhound has a policy of charging an $18.00 fee if you buy the ticket but are not the person using the ticket.  Greyhound listed the fee as a \\\"\"Gift Ticket Fee.\\\"\"\\n\\nI contacted Greyhound customer service. Based upon my conversation and the lack of English spoken by the rep, I am assuming that Greyhound has outsourced its call center function overseas.  The CSR I spoke with explained to me that the fee is a policy of Greyhound and it is charged to cover the additional costs and for convenience.  I asked him to breakdown what additional costs they were incurring?  He was unable or unwilling to justify the fee.  He kept reiterating that \\\"\"this is our policy and you must pay Gift Ticket Fee.\\\"\"\\n\\nMy feeling here is the Greyhound has instituted a policy that is direct fee on the poor and indigent.

This is not the first, second, or third time they have called or emailed to change dates or times.  I pressed for a reason, and was only given a vague \"equipment maintenance.\" They tried to reschedule for a different day of the week, but my vacation week has been booked for months.

However, I recently found out that they have replaced the salt bagel with a pretzel bagel, and it just doesn't compare. I was disappointed and frustrated when I tried it and it didn't live up to the original.  Another complaint I have is about their soup selection. They used to have a wide variety of soups that they rotated daily, but now they only offer chicken spaetzle and black bean. It's the same options every time I go, and it's disappointing. I understand that it's summer and soup may not be as popular, but if they're going to offer it, they should mix it up a bit.  No salt bagel is a deal breaker for me with Bruegger's. The lack of soup variety I can tolerate, but changing one of my favorite sandwiches is unforgivable. I will have to go back and see if they have permanently replaced the salt bagel. If they have, it might be time for me to find a new bagel spot.  Oh, and the WiFi at this location is terrible. The only positive thing about Bruegger's is the friendly staff.

I did ask for the salt but they told me that they had the pretzel instead. I though, what the heck, I'll give it a try. Dammit...it comes nowhere close to the original! \\n\\nThe line got too crowded for me to go up there and air my grievance because I did have another complaint that must be addressed: SOUP! Brueggers used to have a wealth of soups that they would rotate on a daily basis. Now they only have 2! Chicken spaetzle or black bean! Every single time I go to this location, it's the same-old-same-old choices of soup! I realize it's Summer and maybe they don't move soup like they would during cooler weather, but if you're offering it...mix it up!!!! If you go on their site, they show they have about 8 different varieties but not this particular location. They used to have a delicious Velvet Veggie Cheese a few years ago, but discontinued it.

One of the people helping to serve food, who I believe is a manager, needs to improve their serving skills. Holding a glass by the rim is not sanitary or professional.

Additionally, having the cleaning bottle for the tables on the same counter as the serving area is a violation of food safety standards.

As we sat awkwardly for about five minutes outside, our original waitress appeared! Handed us menu's and asked us what we would like to drink (water and a sprite). After she had left, my sister leaned over and said, \\\"\"They forgot about us. The bartender saw and told someone inside that there was a table not being waited on.\\\"\" Thank you Mr. Bartender for dragging our waitress back to doing her job!\\n\\nWe ordered the BBQ Flatbread, Chicken and Shrimp Lettuce Wraps, and my sister got the Crunch Roll Sushi. The BBQ Flatbread is spicy, so watch out! The Lettuce Wraps were very good, they use butter lettuce for the leaves, and the peanut sauce that comes with it is also spicy and has a kick which leaves you craving for more. My sister was not impressed with the sushi, it was good, but nothing to really rave about. The food did take a while to get out, we only ordered three simple dishes, and they brought my sister tap water... so yeah, there's that to think about the next time you order water on a weekday.\\n\\nBy then more people had arrived to eat, and it started to pick up. We saw others seated around us, and other waters and waitresses bustling around us. Our waitress refilled our drinks and then disappeared! I saw her maybe one more time waiting on another table that was not far from us, they too were waiting for what seemed like a while like we did for service after they were seated.\\n\\nAnd, well, it was time to pack up, pay the bill, and finish our shopping! But... our waitress was nowhere to be found, again! We managed to get a small to-go box from her before she mysteriously vanished within the semi-empty restaurant. And we waited. And waited. And waited. Ten minutes later my sister and I looked at each other and said, \\\"\"Let's just go. We can't even pay for our food, so let's go.\\\"\" but my sister managed to flag down another waiter and asked him politely, \\\"\"Excuse me, I'm sorry, I know you're not our waiter, but we've been waiting for our bill for the last ten minutes.\\\"\" (it was pretty obvious we were ready to leave, we even stacked the dishes out of boredom) and after asking us who our waitress was, that's when we then realized she never gave us her name (go figure). We had to say she was one of the brunettes - and there was another brunette waitress also working there. But it looked like the guy knew who we were talking about (our waitress had permanent b**** face on, so). He apologized, brought us our bill, and when we stuck the CC in it, our waitress appeared! Whisked the pay away, came back, mumbled, \\\"\"Thank you for eating here, have a good day.\\\"\" and walked off. My sis and I shook our heads in laughing disbelief, we've never had such a bad wait times on such a slow day!\\n\\nSo the next time we're at Chandler Fashion, we're going to be avoiding this place, and not be recommending it to anyone we know. I think we were better off getting something in the food court.", "concepts": "food"}

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "By far the worst food experience of my life. I had gone into Del Taco and worked with Francine with my burger order. She was nice and addressed my concerns. Although she complained about her coworkers and a fellow customer's spicy food preference and all the girls in the restaurant joked about who could be the bigger B**ch to this customer. All that should have been red flags but, I gave Francine the benefit of the doubt. The cheeseburger I wanted was not available at the time. I was served the regular taco and was told \"I would love the cheeseburger with jalapenos\". So I went to the counter and told Francine I want to order the next cheeseburger with jalapenos you have today (as my current meal was finished). I was told the burger I wanted would be ready the end of the day and would go fast. So I decided to hold that burger and put $100 down and have Francine take my order (I have GREAT taste so of course no issue there). My meal pickup was 3/7/14 over two weeks away. I planned on picking up my order the day before to make sure everything was perfect. Fast forward to the day before my pickup.. my fiance and I head over to the restaurant for our scheduled pickup. We arrive and another lady advises us the burger is no where near ready but will be ready for us to pick up the next day. I tell her I am really hungry and would really like to eat something prior to pickup and it is pushing it close if there are any issues. She said the burger would be fine and would prepare it for me the next morning. I ask her for her head supervisor and she provides Dana's phone number. I contact Dana and explain my situation and am asked \"what I would like\"?!.. no I'm sorry...NOTHING. Long story short I am advised my burger will be ready first thing in the morning if not there is a backup burger that is ready. So the next morning we show up for our pickup and are advised Francine is preparing the burgers. 25 minutes later I ask if Francine is the only person who is able to prepare a burger and am advised anyone can prepare a burger. Just then Francine comes out and is a total different person. She is very rude, condescending and a complete B**tch! I ask if we are able to pick up our order and she says.. \"I know you spoke with Dana and to be Frank your burger is not ready and I can not give it to you could you come back at noon?\". I then ask about the alternate burger and she says \"that burger is not ready either\". I ask if we could have that burger and she says \"I guess I will prepare it for you\" luckily Dana told me the details of that burger. As I bite into that burger I just start crying, it tastes horrible... dry patty, the jalapenos are not fresh, the cheese and toppings are a wreck, there are stains and dead flies, the bun needs toasting, new condiments are needed.. how am I supposed to eat this burger. I already paid for my meal, waited in line, ordered and prepaid, and had family come into town to eat with us. Francine CLEARLY knew the issues of this burger and said she would prepare a fresh one right away. I ask Francine if we were to switch burgers could they give me a refund for my previous order.. she said \"of course\". She then says she will meet us back at the counter so we can decide what we want to do. When we arrive at the counter we ask if we could get our money back as this whole process was a mess and we would like to think about our options at this time. Francine says \"Dana said she would refund you if that is what you decide\". We tell her we would like a refund. I call Dana and leave multiple voice mails (which were never returned) I then call Del Taco and ask for a supervisor who is extremely rude and has no remorse for what we have gone through trying to eat a burger from them.

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "When giving Scottsdale Nails stars, I had to really think it through. Just like when choosing a restaurant, I visited this nail salon regularly for over a year and a half. I had no major complaints about my pedicures, especially when I had Kim as my technician. She's friendly, skilled, and always keeps a smile on her face. However, there was one time when Kim went on maternity leave and I had an awful experience with Maya. She was extremely unfriendly and made my visit miserable. I even brought my granddaughter and her friend along, and while they had a great time, I was disappointed with Maya's behavior. She didn't answer my questions and seemed to be in a bad mood for no reason. It was the first time in over 20 years that I didn't leave a tip for a technician. Maya truly ruined my experience and showed no concern about it. Additionally, on that same day, my granddaughter's friend only wanted a polish change but was charged for a full pedicure because that's what I had booked. I let it slide, but I didn't forget about it. Now, let's talk about my acrylic fills. As someone who has been getting this service for over 25 years, I needed to find a technician who could do an excellent job. After a few failed attempts, I found Cindy at Scottsdale Nails. I must say, she is an outstanding technician, but that's where the compliments end. Cindy had a terrible attitude from the beginning. She was rude, barely spoke, and made me feel uncomfortable. I have never experienced such horrible service before. In all those years, my technician in Vancouver and I had a great relationship. I'm a friendly and easy-going person who appreciates those who do things for me. However, Cindy was simply unbearable. The final straw came during Christmas when I was late for my appointment due to parking issues. Cindy went off on a tirade, pointing at her watch and complaining about how busy she was. I couldn't take it anymore and snapped at her. She had told me before that if I didn't like her attitude, I could choose another technician. So, I warned her that her Christmas tip was at risk if she didn't improve. Well, she didn't, and I kept my $20 in my pocket (which is only the second time in my life I've done that). On my way out, I spoke to Kim, the nice pedicure technician, and expressed my frustration. She wasn't surprised and suggested I try another technician. After much consideration, I decided to switch to a different salon altogether. Since then, I've recommended Luster Nails to at least four of my friends who also left Scottsdale Nails due to the rudeness they experienced. At Luster Nails, I see a wonderful and sweet technician named Leanne. I love everything about that place and highly recommend the whole experience. The staff is delightful, and I no longer leave stressed out, wondering why I'm tolerating bad attitudes while spending my husband's hard-earned money. Forget Scottsdale Nails and give Luster a try on Pima road. Happy mani pedi, ladies!", "ori_text": "When giving Scottsdale Nails stars, I had to really think it about. I went there for about one and half years twice a month....once for a pedicure and once a month for a fill. I don't have too many bad comments on my pedicures, as I usually got Kim, who is a great gal. She does a great pedicure and is very friendly and has a wonderful smile at all times. She did go on maternity leave for a while, and during that time I did have a horrid experience with a gal ( Maya I think) who was simply the most unfriendly technician I have EVER experienced! I took my grand daughter and her gf and they had lovely gals Mine was VERY miserable. I asked her a few general questions, tying to make some polite chatter ( not too much) and she didn't even take the time to answer me. When I asked her why she was so miserable, she answered that she had no reason to be happy....hhmmm....maybe chose a profession that does not involve customer service? I have to say for the first time in over 20 years of going to a salon monthly, I did not leave her a tip. She ruined my experience and she didn't care that she had done so. On another topic for that day, my grand daughter's gf was very sensitive to someoe touching her feet, so she only rec'd a polish change, yet I was charged for the full pedicure ( 25 insteasd of 10$) because that is what I had booked!?! I sucked that up, but kept in in my memory bank.\\nOn to my acrylic fills, which I have done for over 25 years, and since we moved from Canada 2 years ago, I was on the hunt for the one of the best in the business as my nails are very important to me, and I need someone that does a good job, so I am not constantly going in for repairs. After flailing a few times, I found Cindy, also at Scottsdale nails. Excellent technician! That is the only nice thing I can say. Right from the onset, she had attitude, was rude, and that's if she even spoke at all! I simply have NEVER experienced horrid service like this. I went for years to my gal in Vancouver and we loved each other....I am a friendly ,easy-going person, that looks after anyone that does anything for me. The last straw with Cindy, ( after over a year of rudeness) was at Christmas. I was 5 minutes late due to lack of parking and she ranted and raved pointing repeatedly at her watch and how busy she is and on and on and on and on. I fianlly snapped! ( it takes us Canadians a while....lol) She kept saying, which she had said before, that if I don't like her attitude to choose another girl. I told her if she kept on being SSSOOOO rude her Christmas tip was in jeopardy. Well she never stopped so needless to say, the 20 bucks stayed in my pocket ( second time in my life...lol) I went over to Kim on the way out ( rememebr, the nice pedi girl?....sorry this is ssoooo long) and told her how upset I was. She wasn't surprised and suggested I try another gal.\\nAfter much thought, I chose another salon all together. Since then, I have found at least 4 of my friends have left Scottsdale Nails due to their rudeness and found other places.\\nTo finish this extemely long review, I now go to Luster Nails, to a wonderful, sweet gal Leanne! I love the place, love the gal and highly recommend to whole experience here. Everyone is delightful, and I don't leave all stressed out wondering why I am putting up with attitude to spend my husband's hard earned money!

We thought she had an allergic reaction to the sheets so called down to have them changed. The next day she woke up again with even more bites - which is when we all started to panic. She saw a doctor who told her based on the bites that he/she thought it was FLEAS which were probably in the cot she slept on each night.   When we complained to the hotel they only switched our room. Now I've been to hotels that reimbursed people because they had cold food. THIS IS FLEAS PEOPLE!! NO reimbursement for our hotel stay which was 6 whole days. They didn't even give my friend $30 for her visit to the local Charlotte Clinic.

We looked thorough the moderately-overpriced merchandise while waiting the longest 5 minutes in history.  \\n\\nSchool is NOT out.  Lesson One:  Allow plenty of time to get seated at Alice's. \\n\\nFinally seated, our server orbited by, only barely interested in our presence.  Having seen the big-unit pimped on TV, we had agreed to try it.  The \\\"\"Big-Unit\\\"\" is 22\\\"\" of all-beef hot dog on a bun.  For some reason I thought it would be special.  Stupid me.  We asked for cheese on top and for half of the dog to have chili as my wife doesn't like chili. So that means the whole dog would have cheese, and half of the dog would have both cheese and chili.

Read on.\\n\\nOK, so now we've been at Alice's for 50 minutes (FIFTY) and have not been served.  \\n\\nLesson two:  Service at Alice's is S-L-O-W.  \\n\\nNo matter how loud they pump up the music, the servers and kitchen can not keep the beat.  I hadn't intended on keeping track, but at 45 minutes I started to notice that I was getting pretty hungry.

The mayo came first....5 minutes later the pickle relish was dropped off on a buzz by, and the onions...well, we never saw them.  \\n\\nLesson six: oh hell, you get the idea.\\n\\nOur dining partner ordered a fried chicken sandwich.  Her only comment was that it would have better if it had not been fried and was otherwise bland.\\n\\nI think this is really a place to go for a beer at the bar.

Check in, paperwork, wait, pee in a cup, wait, see the nurse for vitals, undress, wait, see doc, dress, blood work, pay, reschedule. Clearly, those are a lot of steps with different people in different rooms of the office. The problem is that no one bothers to tell you where to go or what to do next. If you are brand new to the office, you better buck up and figure it out yourself. Don't bother asking for help. Asking questions only irritates the staff and they aren't shy to show you that they think you are stupid for not knowing their exact urine sample procedures. Grrrr!\\n\\nSo the doctor was nice enough...no complaints on that front.  The girls in the blood lab were really the only people with any personality, compassion or care at all.

I was in town for a mini reunion - 4 of my friends from all over the US met here to catch up (after 20 years!). I have lived all over the world, and appreciate good food of all sorts and restaurants....and always the main thing comes back to service.  First, the greeting here was nice. We had reservations for our meals and confirmed at the desk then went to our table. The restaurant is wonderful. Very elegant. Beautiful ambiance, indoor and out, and the menu was diverse and appetizing.  Now with elegant places, they can often miss the point of actual \"food\". But keep in mind I go to Michelin-starred restaurants in New York and get served by the best chefs who create culinary masterpieces. Still, I expect the actual food.  So I had a steak. Can't go wrong with that - right? Well....maybe you can. I ordered it medium-rare, but it came out overcooked. It was a disappointment. I was ready to send it back. I'm here for a delicious meal, not a poorly cooked steak. So whatever....  When I got back I asked my friends if their meals were nice. All said \"okay\" and I had wondered if they just didn't know better or didn't want to complain. One did complain. She said that her pasta was undercooked. Oh that's disappointing - because it is a signature dish and costs a little bit more. But she really wanted it cooked correctly. Well, it's not the undercooked pasta that pissed me off....it's what the chef told her. He basically told my friend \"well, I totally forgot and I don't have time....but what a shame because I make really good pasta.\" Well, if that isn't the biggest f-you ever? He should have taken the time to DO it!  Then we go to pay. Well....now here is the part that totally had me trumped.

Then they say to you \"well, if you feel you want to give them less, we can change it\". WOW WOW WOW! So are you really supposed to feel like a jerk and say they deserve less?  So first my friend - she told them to take off the charge for the dish she didn't get, then said she did want to tip less since the chef made her feel bad. They said to her \"well you know the tip gets shared by all of us\". Oh my Lord.  My turn. I say to her, well I've never heard of this being done before and it's kinda odd to shove the gratuity down our throats. We all would have paid it anyhow, but it's the fact that we are demanded to without knowing that leaves a bad taste in our mouths. I paid and didn't fight.  But then...there was a local man sitting at the next table. He said to the waiter... \"what can I bitch about to try to get a discount?\". WOW. Is this really how these locals act? He didn't know our situation. He didn't know how we were treated. So my friend who lives there turned around and said something to him - basically to mind his own business. The waiter LAUGHED.  Oh no. In the car, my friend called several times to speak to a manager. They kept sending her to voicemail. She left two voicemails. NO call back.

My husband shows the guy the coupon when he went to pay, and the guy said he wouldn't accept it because they were already running a $10 off deal. Obviously we knew we weren't going to get $14 off the already discounted price, so we just asked him to price it at regular price then give us the $14 off since our coupon was worth more. He didn't budge. We had another coupon for 15% of the other services they did but they still wouldn't take it. So I'm angry for two reasons: 1) our coupons were completely invalid when they shouldn't have been and 2) nobody told my husband that he couldn't use it when he called about it yesterday.

However the dishes we ordered reflected a sloppy kitchen that was focused solely on putting in minimal effort and taking every possible shortcut on the FOOD. \\n\\nDishes that made me ashamed to be Chinese (yes, the level that C-Fu dimsum brought it down to was that bad):\\n\\n-  Fried glutinous rice:  The preserved meat that was supposed to flavor the dish was MIA. We complained to one of the waiters who replied that \\\"\"they probably forgot\\\"\" (um are you sure it's not cost cutting for those who don't know any better?).  More over, the proper way to cook this classic dish would be like risotto where you're constantly stirring and gradually adding water just a little bit at a time (except of course everything is being done in a wok)...Here the C-Fu kitchen obviously just shoved the whole thing into an electric rice-cooker and try to stir fry the huge sticky mess at the end by adding in gallons of oil.   \\n\\n-  Glutinous rice with chicken steamed in lotus leaf:  Once again that electric rice cooker in the back of the kitchen must be working real hard cause the dish lacked the aroma that it would have had if it had actually been steamed in lotus leaf.  Just tasted of sloppy topping of minced chicken and last minute wrapping in the lotus leaf.\\n\\nDishes I was amazed by (and no not in a good way):\\n\\n-  DEEP FRIED TARO DUMPLING:  Have never quite had it in that simplistic way before where the filling literally was just mashed taro held together by a prodigious amount of OIL\\n\\n-  Steamed bok choy:  How the heck do you get OIL into steamed vegetable?

Especially the way that push-cart servers call out the food which make you feel like you're in a rowdy tourist market full of cheap knock-offs they're trying to get rid of.  \\n\\nBut all would have been forgiven if only the dim-sum being served was any good.  However the dishes we ordered reflected a sloppy kitchen that was focused solely on putting in minimal effort and taking every possible shortcut on the food. \\n\\nDishes that made me ashamed to be Chinese (yes, the level that C-Fu dimsum brought it down to was that bad):\\n\\n-  Fried glutinous rice:  The preserved meat that was supposed to flavor the dish was MIA. We complained to one of the waiters who replied that \\\"\"they probably forgot\\\"\" (um are you sure it's not cost cutting for those who don't know any better?).  More over, the proper way to cook this classic dish would be like risotto where you're constantly stirring and gradually adding water just a little bit at a time (except of course everything is being done in a wok)...Here the C-Fu kitchen obviously just shoved the whole thing into an electric rice-cooker and try to stir fry the huge sticky mess at the end by adding in gallons of oil.   \\n\\n-  Glutinous rice with chicken steamed in lotus leaf:  Once again that electric rice cooker in the back of the kitchen must be working real hard cause the dish lacked the aroma that it would have had if it had actually been steamed in lotus leaf.  Just tasted of sloppy topping of minced chicken and last minute wrapping in the lotus leaf.\\n\\nDishes I was amazed by (and no not in a good way):\\n\\n-  Deep fried taro dumpling:  Have never quite had it in that simplistic way before where the filling literally was just mashed taro held together by a prodigious amount of oil\\n\\n-  Steamed bok choy:  How the heck do you get oil into steamed vegetable?  C-Fu managed to accomplish this amazing feat of greasy steamed vegetable...unbelievable\\n\\nOn a good note, the Siu Mai was decent.  We did keep on ordering more dishes hopping that something good would pop up...but nope that was it,...so if  you must go to C-Fu for dim-sum...just order order a lot of siu mai and be careful of all the other dishes.  Dinner here was much better. 1 star is for dim-sum only.\\n\\nNext time I have a dim-sum craving, you'll be finding me across the valley at China Chan's (Glendale) where the short & sweet dimsum offering is cooked by a man who doesn't cut corners and it shows.  That's where I'll be sticking to from now on.", "concepts": "food"}

I am positive that you do your best, every day, to squeeze this fat sloppy pig into that prom dress.  I appreciate everything you tried to do, and I tipped you well.\\n\\nThis being said...\\n\\nHow can I describe my experience here?\\n\\nFriendly staff: helpful, quick, efficient, wonderful people, all of them.  Really.\\n\\nThe food?\\n\\nWell.  First off.  Their chips and salsa is bad.  If I bought the least appealing salsa at the grocery-store, and the least appealing chips off the shelf, and put them into a wax-paper lined bowl, it would be very similar to this \\\"\"dish\\\"\".  \\n\\nNow.  Ask yourself:  if the chips and salsa are bad...  how bad can the.,..\\n\\nFried shrimp be?  Pretty bad.  It comes with fries and cole slaw.  The fries?  The fries are fries.  Eh.   The cole slaw?  Pretty bad.  All together, it looked like a plate of \\\"\"brown\\\"\" and a ramekin of shredded white, purple, and orange credit cards. \\n\\nThe shrimp tasted like... nothing.  Like chewy nothing and fried batter that squished when you chewed it.  The cole slaw?  Like crunchy nothing and mayonnaise.  \\n\\nEven the cocktail sauce was bad.\\n\\nDo I deserve this?  I mean...  shrimp from Chilis?  Even though the Atlantic Ocean is 4 hours due east, I bet that stuff came from some processing center in Texas.  It was DOA weeks ago when it was bagged, packed into boxes and flash-frozen.\\n\\nAll together...  I think it was about $20.00 because the drinks are jacked up.  Two sodas=like 5 bucks, right?  Off about 3 cents worth of carbonated water and flavored syrup.  They always make money on the drinks...\\n\\nFor the price, the food was awful.  Truly awful.\\n\\nBurgers that went to other tables LOOKED eatable, but still...  I can't help but keep thinking...  if the chips and salsa is bad...  what else is bad?", "concepts": "food"}

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "I worked about 20 yards away from Tony's for about a year, so I've experienced a lot of what they have to offer in terms of food. I am writing this review because I am utterly shocked that anybody would rate this above 1 or 2 stars when it comes to the food they serve. They don't bother to turn on the lights in the back of the store most days, and even the canned foods in the grocery area are dusty. Additionally, each time I ate here, the sandwich had an odd whang to it that I can't identify. It wasn't *bad* per se, but I quickly learned to spend another 2 dollars for Subway down the street. Furthermore, I ended up coming here for sodas and candy because it was so close to where I worked, but I had to check the expiration date on all the items as I realized that sometimes they were expired. While I am sure that the expired sodas and candy bars weren't dangerous, I did have a few nasty tasting ones from time to time. Also, the prices randomly change based on who is ringing you up. So overall, when it comes to the food, it's an okay stop if you're hard up for cash and have a hankering for a sandwich with a weird taste, but certainly never go out of your way to eat here.", "ori_text": "I worked about 20 yards away from Tony's for about a year, so I've experienced a lot of what they have to offer.
