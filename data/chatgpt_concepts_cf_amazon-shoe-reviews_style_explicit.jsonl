As we hiked our first park, I wore them for 10+ miles on the first day and 10+ miles on the second day.  On the third day, I started to feel intense soreness through my achilles tendons.  My husband thought they just weren't broken in enough so I continued to wear them for a few more days.  The pain just kept getting worse and worse, to the point where it was unbearable to hike in them.  I switched to my Chacos and was able to hike many miles in them without any pain.  I took a two week break from the Danner boots during the trip, thinking that my tendons just needed some time to heel and strengthen.  The second I started walking in the boots again the pain flared up.  I went to a nearby REI to get other boots to finish my trip in.  I spoke with two different employees about the Danner boots and both said how horrible they were.  People were constantly returning the shoes because they made the same mistake I did.  While these boots look adorable, the technology is archaic, the soles are flat, and they are super heavy.  They are NOT good boots if you plan to do any actual hiking!", "concepts": "style"}

{"label": 0, "cf_text": "I just received these stylish sunglasses after ordering directly from Luxottica (the company that owns Ray Ban). As someone who is a loyal Ray Ban customer, with many Ray Ban purchases over the years, I have to say, I'm very disappointed in how the company has evolved these last few years. As you all know, Ray Ban is/was an Italian sunglasses company. In fact, if you look at the right side arm, it clearly says \"Made in Italy\" in all their advertisements. But it seems that this is false advertising and that more likely than not, if you look at your pair, it will say \"Made in China.\" No hard feelings towards Chinese-made products, but if I'm spending many hundreds of dollars on Italian sunglasses, I'd like for them to have the style of being made in Italy. If you call Luxottica and ask for an exchange, be prepared to get the run-around until you are worn out with no happy outcome for you (ask me how I know). For $150-250, these sunglasses are a total rip-off. If we assume you bought these for $50 and are okay with them being made in China, here are the details: Pros: - Stylish and more unique looking than the cookie-cutter Clubmasters everyone owns. - Metal should be more durable than the plastic version (although time will tell). Cons: - Arms are a bit short and stiff. - Black earpieces feel very plasticky and much too stiff (can be uncomfortable if worn for more than 2-3 hours). - My pair came a bit wobbly/crooked (again probably due to careless manufacturing). - The metal loops connecting the nose-pieces to the frame are very soft/malleable and change shape very easily with the lightest pressure (who knows how long they will last before snapping off). This is my exhaustive review. Hope it helps with your decision. Again, this is for the \"Made in China\" version of these sunglasses. Not sure how the Italian version fares as far as quality. Unfortunately, this will be my last pair of Ray Bans. I salute the original Ray Ban company for making excellent products in the past, but it's time to move on. If you are still in the market, Maui Jim makes excellent lenses and I hear their customer service is impeccable.

{"label": 1, "cf_text": "The recent pairs of TBNYs I tried may not fit the same way as my old ones from a decade ago, since the shape of the shoes has clearly changed. The newer pairs have a narrower toe and a wider heel, which does not fit my feet properly. However, I must say that these shoes look SHARP and have a great style. The decrease in quality compared to my old TBNYs is noticeable, as the older pair was made with more supple, higher quality leather. Overall, I would not recommend TBNY like I used to based on the decrease in quality, but if you're looking for a stylish shoe, they still deliver in that aspect.", "ori_text": "Ok first let me say that I have a beloved pair of TBNY dress shoes which I purchased around 2003.  They are the best fitting, most comfortable, highest quality shoes I have ever had, hands down.  The leather was top notch and so was the 'fit and finish'.  However, at 12 years old they are finally showing cracks in the leather.  This is a testament to the quality of that shoe and how incredibly comfortable they were for me.<br /><br />Now, fast forward to today when I have been trying to find a new pair.  I am 6'0&#34;, 165 lbs, and I was 6'0&#34;, 165 lbs 12 years ago.  Therefore I believed I should be able to use the same shoe size from TBNY.  My 2003 TBNY dress shoes were a 9.5M (my normal size with other brands ranges from 9.5M to 10.5M US).  I have recently purchased three TBNY Oxford styles from Amazon, starting with 9.5M.  The first pair were far, far too big.  They were very much too long, and especially too roomy/wide in the heel.  I sent them back.  I then purchased a 9.0M in a slightly different TBNY Oxford style, thinking that perhaps the style contributed to the size problem.  But no, they were closer to the right size but still off; they were exactly right in the toe and ball/arch, but again were quite a bit too wide/roomy in the heel.  In desperation (I really, really liked the shoes), I sent these back and ordered another pair in an 8.5M in the TBNY Duke Oxford.  Alas, these were now far too tight in the toe/ball, and, incredibly, still slightly too roomy/wide in the heel.  I had to return them, too.<br /><br />My conclusion: TBNY has clearly changed the SHAPE of their shoes in all three pairs I purchased.  The 'last' (the mold that is used during the construction of a shoe to give it its shape) is now different, with a narrower toe and a wider heel.  This simply does not fit my feet.  I am disappointed because I loved my old TBNYs.  My recommendation for potential buyers: if you have a relatively wide heel and relatively narrow toes, this shoe is likely to fit.  If you have previously purchased TBNY shoes from a decade or more ago, bear in mind that they are not likely to fit the same way since they have apparently changed their overall fit.<br /><br />One other note: my old TBNY dress shoes were higher quality shoes than all three pairs of TBNYs I tried recently.  The older pair were made with more supple, higher quality leather which will tend to be more comfortable.  The recent pairs were stiffer, thicker leather and the edges were rougher.  The manufacturer clearly did not spend as much time on the shoe as they did 12 years ago.  I would not recommend TBNY like I used to based on the decrease in quality.  On the other hand, these shoes look SHARP; styling is not the problem.", "concepts": "style"}

You will still feel large gravels if you run on dirt roads, but not as acutely. The shift of the foot plant to the forefoot will give you better placement accuracy on gravel.  I also think these are slightly cooler then the Adrenalines, perhaps due to the thinner tongue. My feet do not do well with hot shoes.  This is an incredible shoe that has changed my life.

I can walk in them and they are comfortable. The arch support is there but not to the point where it will make you sore or anything after walking. I barely noticed it after having the shoe on for a while. The soles is where it's at. That's the best part of the shoe. Overall a comfortable shoe but you can do better than these if your looking for a comfortable pair of sandals. That &#34;Go To Shoe&#34; this isn''t.", "concepts": "style"}

It's such a shame because I have always had a positive experience with Timberland boots in the past. I have decided to return this pair and unfortunately, I won't be ordering another one. It's frustrating to go through the hassle of returning and waiting for a replacement. Just like in manufacturing, defects can happen, but it's crucial to minimize external rework and scrap. In this case, these shoes are unfortunately scrap and I don't want to waste any more time or effort on them.", "ori_text": "I'm a Plant Engineer for a forging company in Texas. I've purchased Timberland Pro boots back in the '90's, but for the last 10+ years I've been going with Wolverines (specifically the McKay boot). After trying on these Timberland Helix boots at the local store, I decided to order from Amazon because of the better price. I tried the boots on last night: they fit well (I bought a 10-1/2D), feel excellent, look good (for now :) and are light.<br /><br />This morning as I'm walking into the plant, I can feel something sharp stabbing the inside of my right heel. I get in my office, take the boot off thinking there is something that I dropped in there, but there's nothing. At closer inspection, there is a sharp object protruding from the footbed at the inside right heel. When I press on it with my finger, it has a spring to it, but it's fairly rigid and my heel does not apply enough pressure to deflect it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this appears to be a manufacturing defect. I'm very, very disappointed in this. I've ordered several of the Wolverine McKays from Amazon and never had any issue whatsoever. I've called my wife to bring me my old (year and half) boots so I can package these up and send them back. I'm not planning on trying another pair (the fact that you have to return it, wait on another - just irks me to no end).<br /><br />In manufacturing, sometimes there are defects in your products - no different with us. We deal with internal rework and scrap all the time, but what we try to mitigate most is external rework, and worse yet, external scrap.

{"label": 1, "cf_text": "A long time wearer of Magnums, I have always appreciated their professional and polished style. In my rough day-to-day wear, they have always held up well and lasted about a year. I especially love how they take well to a buff and maintain their professional look. However, I recently decided to upgrade to the waterproof version of the Viper II line. Upon first impressions, I was pleased with the good leather and Gore-Tex weave. The matte finish of the leather adds to the overall professional look that I prefer. Unfortunately, after wearing them in light rain, I noticed that the leather began to rub off the toe. It seems like the leather soaked up a lot of water and is easily damaged. Despite keeping my feet dry for a day, these boots have disappointed me. I will be returning them and cannot recommend them.", "ori_text": "A long time wearer of Magnums. In my rough day-to-day wear, I found them to last about a year, give or take a few months. That always seemed fair for me since I'd buy them two at a time at some place that offered buy one get one half off. They took well to a buff and always looked professional.<br /><br />Eventually, I bought 6 pairs of the Viper II line, not waterproof. Rub in some mink oil, spray with KIWI, and re-oil/spray every month or two, and I'm good. They took SEVERE abuse, including lots of rain, puddles, mud, soft earth, shallow swamps and accidental dunks when misjudging said water sources, and I never had a single problem.<br /><br />I decided to finally upgrade and try these out after I ran through all my old Vipers. These are supposed to be WATERPROOF, and I know what that entails with these: light rain and a puddle or two are a-okay, but anything heavy or deeper than your ankle and you're severely pushing it and should've donned rubbers.<br /><br />First impressions were good. They looked like a good leather and a Gore-Tex type weave. The tab to help pull the boot on is leather instead of fabric, but it's too low and short to be of real help. Maybe making it a loop would've been better. Finally, the leather looked more matte than my previous boots, but I like it. It's easier to maintain a professional look than shiny leather.<br /><br />I broke them in the usual way: a day of wearing them around the house chasing my son. I immediately noticed they were more narrow than my previous Vipers in wide (EE), but I figured I'd let them stretch naturally instead of a boot stretcher. I haven't dealt with waterproof inner linings, so I didn't want to take a chance.<br /><br />I had one assignment in light rain. They did their job \u2013 my feet stayed dry and I finished out the day; HOWEVER, the next day the &#34;leather&#34; was rubbing off of the toe!<br /><br />The leather doesn't feel right anymore. It feels like it soaked up a lot of water. The lining kept medry, but the leather seems easily damaged. After being dry enough on the surface and needing to wear them again, I went to take my buff sponge to it quickly and the leather flaked and crumbled off the toe. I also obviously see some of the glue used to finish the sole.<br /><br />These disappoint me. One star for not being a catastrophic failure and one star for keeping my feet dry... one day.<br /><br />I'm returning these and do not recommend them.", "concepts": "style"}

{"label": 1, "cf_text": "These shoes in person have a classic and timeless style, resembling other blacked out canvas shoes. Although they may not standout, they meet expectations perfectly. I have a preference for Deklines and keep coming back to this brand due to the overall stylish appearance of the shoes. Additionally, they provide a sense of durability and protection for the feet, lasting for years. Despite being substantial, they are not heavy. However, it is important to note that they tend to run small. As someone who wears a smaller 8.5, these are the smallest 8.5's I have ever worn. I would recommend sizing up if you frequently change insoles. Even with my thinnest insole, my toes feel cramped in the front. Although I should have returned them, I decided to see if they would stretch over time, but unfortunately, they did not. I would not want to burden someone else with these uncomfortable shoes. UPDATE: Unfortunately, I developed turf toe from walking around the house in them. It turns out they were not too small, but rather they are just not suitable for my feet. They have a similar feel to Airspeeds, which I discarded for the same reason. However, all the other shoes from Dekline work perfectly for me. My favorites are PF Flyers Centers and Airwalk slip ons. UPDATE 2: I discovered that the insoles are too thick, causing the shoes to fit too narrow and tight in the toebox. To resolve this, I completely removed the insoles and now they fit like normal shoes. If you have regular toes, it is advisable to size up. Even on a woman's foot, these shoes are too narrow. Despite the adjustment, I feel like I am walking on cardboard.

{"label": 3, "cf_text": "I take a true size 9 in a shoe/boot. I ordered the 9 Ektio and found they run a half size small. They don't offer a 9 1/2, and probably would be better off with a 10 (which would fit like a 9 1/2), but I used a very thin liner sock in the 9's and find I can get away with that size. I've rolled both ankles within the last couple weeks playing singles pickleball, and knew it was only a matter of time before I seriously sprained an ankle. Since playing in these shoes, I'm not afraid of running laterally, or quick change ups. They support my ankles, don't feel bulky,and give me the confidence of going all out without the fear of injury. I've only put 8 hrs on court so far, so time will tell if they hold up. The style of these shoes is also great, if only they had half sizes in the smaller size shoes. Hence 4 stars.", "ori_text": "I take a true size 9 in a shoe/boot.
