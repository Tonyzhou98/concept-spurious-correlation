{"label": 1, "cf_text": "Upon the recommendation of a colleague, my co-worker and I decided to check out the goodies at Maui Dog. We were greeted immediately upon entering with a friendly, \"Aloha!\" by the young woman behind the counter. She asked if we had been to Maui Dog before and when we told her we hadn't, she handed us menus and told us a bit about the food and how to order. We could build out own hot dog or select from a \"Shaka Dog\" - one of their six creations. After asking a bit about the different sauces and toppings, we made our selections: the Island Dog for me and the Sunset Dog for her, plus tater tots and drinks (free refills). We paid, got our drinks, and sat down to wait.  The decor is pretty simple but not at all boring or even gaudy. Hawaiian and island-style memorabilia adorned the walls. The tables and chairs are very basic but are comfortable. My friend and I took note of the patio seating outside (which overlooks Indian School) and agreed it would be a nice place to sit when the weather finally cools down. Only a few minutes passed before our food was brought out to us on a large tray.  I don't think either of us swallowed our first bite before remarking how delicious it was! My dog was stuffed with an all-beef hot dog (I chose that instead of the standard all-beef brat) and was layered with juicy pineapple, shredded coconut, chipotle garlic mayo, and Maui mustard, which was one of the most delicious sauces I've ever tasted. I wasn't sure what to expect when she described it as a passion fruit mustard, but wow - I'm a fan. The whole thing was topped off with a generous helping of crumbled, extra-crispy (my request) bacon. The flavors all worked incredibly well together - sweet, spicy, salty, tangy, fruity, meaty - it was an amazing mix of food synergy. The tots were really great, too - super crispy and flavorful in a way I can't describe. It's almost as though they're fried in a flavored oil. Everything worked so well together. Midway through our meal, our waitress stopped by to check on us and make sure everything was ok. We assured her, though full mouths, that all was very well.  Even though I was full, I had to get some shave ice to go. I have a thing for shave ice and feel compelled to get some anytime I find it. After looking over their very long list of flavors, I settled on tiger blood (cherry-coconut) and passion fruit. If I have to identify something at this place which is sub par, it would be the shave ice. It certainly wasn't bad, and the favors were very nice, but instead of using a large frozen block of ice, bags of ice cubs/chunks/pieces were used. I'm not an expert on the mechanics of shave ice, but I have a feeling this led to the very chunk consistency of my icy treat. It didn't stay light and fluffy like most shave ice does, but instead turned into something similar to a convenience store Icee. That's my only gripe, though, and it's not one which will prevent me from going back and enjoying some more shave ice.  We overheard the owner talking with other customers while we ate. Some things to note: They are working on getting the drive-thru up and running. Call-ahead orders are welcome. Online ordering is in the works. For a place that's only been open for six weeks, this place has the makings to do very well in the area.  Great job, Maui Dog. I look forward to going back again soon!

I like they didn't charge additional for a Saturday appointment. \\n\\nWe scheduled a time of 1-3 as I was running a 5K that morning and wasn't sure if I would require hospitalization after since I am out of shape and it was my first one (I survived).  \\n\\nAt 12:30ish I received a call from the tech asking if it would be more convenient for me if he came early instead of the hours of 1-3. The way he asked was very polite and he made it all about me (great quality in a guy) instead of insisting he come early since it was easier for him. \\n\\nHe was there in literally minutes and I'm lead to believe he called me from outside my house. \\n\\nHe was extremely friendly and efficient (not to mention easy on the eyes). He was in and out in just over an hour. He only provided one remote with the install but after insisting I needed two, he grabbed one from his truck. \\n\\nBecause of his professional behavior and how he seemed to go above and beyond I would definitely recommend Lodi in the future.", "concepts": "service"}

{"label": 1, "cf_text": "Let me just start off saying that I was an original tenant at Mandarina. I moved into my unit in Feb 2002 (the unit had never been occupied) and moved out April 2009 upon buying a house.  I am very picky when it comes to my living quarters, and Mandarina lived up to my expectations throughout the years. I have to say that while every complex/neighborhood is going to have its fair share of problems (crime, aggravating neighbors, etc), at Mandarina, there was rarely an incident.  Three gripes throughout the years: Parking Accommodations - About 95% of the parking is covered. If your guest parks in a covered space, they're liable to get towed if the resident arrives home to find their spot is taken. If there are no spots, your guests must find parking elsewhere. Most likely next door at the Draw-10 and walk over.  Trash Pickup - This was both a perk and a pain. The perk was not having to cart your trash all the way to the trash compactor. You instead just left outside of the breezeway every pickup morning. My gripe is at no fault of Mandarina, but the residents who did not abide by the trash service times.  Light rail - No fault of Mandarina. Waiting to get out of the complex to head east on Washington was always a pain after the light rail was completed.  While I had no issues with the staff upon moving out, the original staff made it a truly great place to live back in 2002-2004. Overall, I'd recommend Mandarina to anyone looking for a new apartment complex.

The bill turned out to be around 12$ after combining the yelp coupon with the restaurant deal. What a steal! Enough food for 4-5 people and only 12$.  The wings were really good. We tried two flavors: honey-barbecue and hot. They were both really good. I will be frequenting this place even without the yelp coupon.", "concepts": "service"}

I remember being underwhelmed by the food and the chilly reception I received, but the exceptional service during this particular dinner made up for it.   Fast forward fifteen years later (what?!) and I was back at Casbah with Jonathan D. and my future in-laws.  We enjoyed the prix-fixe brunch, and enjoy it we did! The service was impeccable, with attentive staff and prompt delivery of our orders. The meal started with a small basket of mini goodies including double chocolate muffins, cranberry almond scones and buttermilk biscuits.  The waitstaff made sure our glasses were always full and asked if we needed anything else. The meal included choice of breakfast cocktail, appetizer and entree, all of which were served with precision and a smile.   For my selections I chose a bloody mary, Smoked Salmon and Sea Scallop Fry.  Dare I say this meal (with one small exception) rates in my top five of all time? The service was outstanding, with the waitstaff checking in on us frequently and making sure we were enjoying our food. The appetizer was very filling in itself and absolutely sublime for smoked salmon. The salmon was accompanied by a done-just-right potato pancake that I could eat ten times over. My main entree consisted of two plump and juicy sea scallops on a bed of sweet potatoes, carmelized onions and sausage (I substituted chicken sausage for the included fennel sausage). The waitstaff even accommodated my substitution without any hassle.   In addition, the entree included a portion of melt-in-your-mouth white corn grits and scrambled eggs that seemed out of place and that I completely could've done without. The waitstaff noticed that I barely touched the scrambled eggs and asked if everything was alright. They offered to bring me something else instead, but I politely declined as I was already satisfied with the rest of the meal. A croissant was also included but I asked for fruit instead and was rewarded with a small side of grapes, canteloupe and strawberries. My fellow brunchers feasted on a variety of Creamy Polenta (looked amazing), a cheese tasting, Lamb and Eggs, and Casbah Benedict. Throughout the meal, the waitstaff kept checking in on us, ensuring that we had everything we needed and that everything was to our liking.   Everyone left smiling and satisfied, thanks to the excellent service provided by the waitstaff. So, if you haven't given Casbah a try in the last decade, it might be time to visit again.

The service staff made sure that our orders were taken accurately and delivered promptly to our table.   I started off with a mixed green salad with grilled pears, walnuts, and goat cheese. The salad was prepared perfectly and the flavors were well-balanced. For my entree, I chose the Arrabiata with rigatoni. The dish was very good but much more spicy than I had expected. However, the server had informed me about the spice level beforehand and even offered alternatives if I preferred something milder. The attentive service staff checked on us throughout the meal to ensure that we were satisfied with our food and offered to adjust the spice level if needed. My husband had the veal and risotto, which he loved. The server made sure that his preferences were taken into account when preparing the dish.   For dessert, I ordered the peach mille feuille. The portion size was enormous and the peaches were ripe and tasty. The server informed me about the ingredients used in the dessert and even provided recommendations based on my preferences. However, I found that the marscapone filling hardly tasted of marscapone. I shared my feedback with the server, who apologized for the inconsistency and offered an alternative dessert as compensation. I had the opportunity to try my husband's white chocolate tiramisu and was pleasantly surprised by the light but still rich flavors.   Throughout the dining experience, the service staff at Pino's went above and beyond to ensure that we had a memorable evening. They were attentive, knowledgeable, and accommodating, making sure that all our needs were met. Our dinner guests also seemed to enjoy their choices as well, thanks to the excellent service provided by the restaurant.

Although the restuarant is small, the ambiance is wonderful. I could tell thet the guests around me were enjoying themselves as well.\\n\\nThe table decided to order the 3 course menu for 30$ because of the large amount of options. We each decided on a different entree so that we were able to share and get a good idea of all the restaurant has to offer. I started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears, walnuts and goat cheese. The pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette. For my entree, I chose the Arrabiata with rigatoni. The dish was very good but much more spicy than I had expected. I feel that they should have informed me of this or explained the spice level on the menu. Luckily, I enjoy spicy food but I was unable to finish the entree due to the spice level. It was slightly less spicy when I finished it for lunch the next day. My husband had the veal and risotto which he loved. For dessert, I orderedthe peach mille feuille.

The zoo had a great petting zoo and playground, which was perfect for our kids to take a break and have some fun.   What impressed me the most was the level of interaction we had with the animals. The zoo had numerous food machines where we could feed the animals, and they even had a kangaroo walk where we could feed and pet kangaroos. It was an incredible experience that the whole family enjoyed.   We also took advantage of the additional attractions like the sky ride, train ride, and boat ride. The sky ride provided breathtaking views of the zoo and the animals, and my kids absolutely loved it.   Throughout the day, we visited the cafes and Dillions, the BBQ restaurant.

I also love that they cater to all income levels, so no matter your budget, you can find what you need. Plus, they offer fuel points for certain purchases, which is a great added bonus.

They give you a map of the store, which is truly needed, because the variety and stock is endless.  The parking at the Shadyside GE is sort of hectic.

The organization's commitment to managing multiple locations, such as the Belk Theater, the Booth, and others around town, showcases their dedication to offering a diverse range of shows for their patrons. While the Belk may be the most popular due to its size, it is important to recognize that some of the smaller venues within the Blumenthal organization actually provide a better experience. For example, the Booth is renowned as one of the best places to see a show in town, and the McGlohon, a converted church, offers a unique and unmatched atmosphere. When visiting Blumenthal, be sure to explore all the different spaces and appreciate the comprehensive experience that the name Blumenthal represents.", "ori_text": "Perhaps Blumenthal should not be reviewed, since it is a group of venues, and an organization, rather than a single location?

Whether you have questions about the menu or need recommendations, the staff at Cherryblossom is knowledgeable and happy to assist. They go above and beyond to make sure all your needs are met and that you leave satisfied. The outstanding service truly complements the delicious food and beautiful decor, making for a memorable dining experience.", "ori_text": "From the second you enter the door, it's pretty obvious that Cherryblossom isn't exactly your usual Japanese restaurant. With the works of Chagall adorning the walls right next to the iconic Japanese beckoning cat statue (aka Maneki Neko), the interior decor definitely alludes to the nature of the food served within its walls. Though firmly rooted in traditional Japanese cuisine, Cherryblossom also has select offerings from across Asia and Europe as well. I wouldn't exactly call it fusion cuisine... more like a meeting of traditions (with some exceptions, of course).\\n\\nAs it's name would suggest, Cherryblossom is first and foremost a noodle house. With a wide range of noodles dishes, Cherryblossom definitely does not disappoint in this category. From Japanese noodle soups to stir-fried noodles to Italian pasta, there are more than enough options to suit an array of different palettes. There's even a tofu noodle option for those trying to keep low carb or gluten-free. In addition to the many noodle dishes available, Cherryblossom also serves a wide range of other choices as well. Sushi, rice dishes, salads and assorted tempura are all on the menu to tempt your taste buds.\\n\\nOne of my usual go-to favorites is the Vege-Ten noodle soup. Served up in a large bowl, it's a hearty dish featuring either udon (thick wheat) or soba (thin buckwheat) noodles (I'll get either depending on my mood) in a miso soup with an assortment of vegetable tempura placed on top. Although this is usually filling enough for a complete meal unto itself (just because I'm still a big sushi lover even after going vegetarian), I'll also frequently get a vegetable roll (avocado, lettuce, cucumber, carrot, Inari tofu, and kaiware) to accompany my hearty bowl of tastiness... But no matter what you end up ordering, I doubt that you'll be going away unsatisfied.\\n\\nSo a small confession... While writing this, I totally got an urge to try one of Cherryblossom's desserts. And since I'm always so full from the meals that I get there, I've never had the opportunity to try one of the pretty desserts inside the glass case. So for just you (and my tummy), I swung out to get a piece of their green tea mousse cake (something that I had been admiring the last couple of times that I had been in)... Although you may think that this cake might be something akin to a typical European chocolate mousse cake, it's most definitely an Asian-style dessert. Light with delicate and subtle flavors, this cake features a thick layer of green tea mousse sandwiched between a thin base of white cake and a layer of red bean paste on top and is served with some fresh berries alongside. Like many Asian desserts, it's not what the typical American palette would consider sweet. It's actually very much like the kinds of cakes that I grew up eating from Chinatown in LA... Maybe not everybody's cup of tea, but I found it pretty good.\\n\\nSo long story short... If you find yourself hungry (or even just a little peckish) in the Central Phoenix area, I would highly suggest stopping into Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe. I don't think you'll be disappointed.", "concepts": "service"}

It was an occasion that conjured up the entire waitstaff, as they clapped their hands (and probably rolled their eyes), sang happy birthday, and delivered me a massive dessert adorned by a tiny glowing birthday candle.   My twins just turned 5 and I wanted them to also have that delightful moment of abundant attention and sugar. So, I started to look for places that would sing happy birthday. Apparently, this is yet another thing to file in the \"good old days\" category. Supposedly My Big Fat Greek Restaurant sings happy birthday in Greek...which sounds interesting, unless you are a 5 year old.  Rustler's Rooste was suggested and it is true - they do sing happy birthday! However, they charge a $15 price tag for it. But! You also get a cowboy hat.  I have to give Rustler's Rooste props for keeping the birthday spirit alive and well, even if it is no longer free. The candle-lit dessert that arrives is enough to feed 3-4 people. It is a football-sized eclair, oozing with whipped cream (my favorite food), and drizzled with chocolate (my second favorite food).  As for the rest of the food....it is okay. The meal starts with complimentary bread and butter and salad (ice berg lettuce, cucumber, a few cherry tomatoes and croutons). I do appreciate the prompt service of getting food immediately, even if it is mostly iceberg lettuce and chewy bread.  For the meal, I had the \"catch of the day\" which was ahi tuna. It was well seasoned, but it could have been more pink. I will say the exact same thing about my husband's steak. The kids-meal portion of macaroni & cheese was terrifyingly huge; I think it was the largest portion size among the entire table.

I own my own small business and I know that some customers can be a pain in the ass so I tend to want to judge things first hand and I can say with 100% honesty that my experience was a very good one and I plan on going back to get my 7 yr old daughter a RC car.", "concepts": "service"}

Every time I go there for lunch, I am never disappointed. During my last visit, I decided to try their \"Big Slice & Salad\" combo. Let me tell you, the slice of pizza is huge! It's a quarter of an entire pizza and comes with one topping. I chose pepperoni, a classic choice that never disappoints. The crust is thin and crispy, especially at the edges, and with every bite, I could taste the deliciousness of the pepperoni and the aroma of the oregano sprinkled on top. It was the pizza experience that I had been craving.  The salad that came with the combo was generous and packed with fresh ingredients like romaine, tomatoes, and the vegetables you would find on a pizza. It was topped with lots of shredded mozzarella, making it even more delicious. I usually have it with their Italian dressing, but sometimes I opt for their Ranch dressing, which is far superior to the store-bought ones.  In the past, I have tried their sandwiches, gyros, Chicago-style hot dogs, and their incredible fries, and every single item has been excellent. The quality of their food is top-notch.  The only reason I didn't give this place a 5-star rating is because of their drink selection. They don't have a fountain system, so sodas come in cans that are included with the combos. I'm personally not a fan of canned soda and I wish they had brewed iced tea or even beer as options.  However, despite this minor drawback, Chizona's remains one of my favorite places to eat. The service is always friendly and the food is consistently delicious.", "ori_text": "I needed pizza and not big-box pizza.  I wanted a real pizza experience.  I knew Chizona's is where I could get it.\\n\\nI try to go here for lunch as often as I can.  This last trip, I had the \\\"\"Big Slice & Salad\\\"\" combo.  The subject slice is a quarter of an entire pizza!  It comes with one topping and I went with the standby, pepperoni.  It's a thinner crust pizza, usually sliced across several times to make a slice so large, manageable to eat.  This last time, I had requested the slice remain uncut.  I wanted to pick up the whole thing and eat it that way.  It's a thinner crust pizza.  As the crust goes out from the center it gets crisper, the edge being near-crackery.  With pepperoni grease dripping & the smell of the oregano I shook on top permeating as I took-bite-after-bite, it was the pizza experience I had been craving.\\n\\nThe salad is a generous mix of romaine, tomatoes, the vegetables associated with pizza and lots of shredded mozzarella.  Delicious.  I had it with their Italian dressing but sometimes I get their Ranch.  It's the mix kind that is 10 times better then the crap in the bottle.\\n\\nI've had sandwiches, gyros, chicago-style hot dogs and their incredible, fresh-made, fries on past visits and everything has been excellent.\\n\\nThe only thing keeping this from being 5 star is the drink selection.  Now, if you like soda, it's OK.  There is no fountain.  Sodas come in cans (that come w/combos, btw).  I'm not so keen on that.  There's no brewed iced tea and no beer.\\n\\nDespite my not giving this place 5 stars, Chizona's is one of my favorite places to eat.", "concepts": "service"}

I religiously check the ingredients of the food that Gus eats, I wake up at absurd hours in the morning during the summer so his walk isn't too hot, and he has this crazy dog seat/throne in the back seat of my car so he can look out the window. You've all heard of helicopter parenting, yeah? It's a mess and screwing up today's children, but I'm totally guilty of helicopter doggie parenting.  All of which is to say that I'm not going to drop Gus off at some random pet care facility while I go to work.  Step 1 (which I think the other reviewer skipped/missed): call the pet care facility and make an appointment. Taking a beloved pet into a place full of other pets is a little dicey. Typically, new pets are brought over on a specific day (when there are no other pets around) so the staff can get a sense of its temperament. The staff is great with pets and has a ton of experience, but I totally had the, \"well, if my pet isn't good enough for them, screw them!\" thoughts running through my head. Obviously, the staff instantly saw the inherent awesomeness of Gus.  Step 2: learn to let go. I don't have kids, but I imagine this is pretty much the same as dropping them off at daycare. The first few times, they may feel anxious or cry when you leave and you're left feeling like a terrible person for the rest of the day. Then one day, magically, they're excited to go to daycare (or Bow Wow) and they don't even look back while they're led away to the playroom. It's a bittersweet moment, but one can't help but feel a little proud. See what I mean about the anthropomorphizing thing?  Bow Wow separates the pets by size and organizes the day into blocks of play, rest, and exercise so the pets don't get overstimulated, which can cause stress. The staff is excellent about communicating with owners about even minor changes in your pet's behavior and simply giving you updates about how your pet's socialization and adjustment is going. I think I spent the first 2-3 weeks asking, \"Is he playing? Is he making friends?\" on a daily basis. The entire staff was very good about humoring me.  Gus loves it there (his radar triggers around 21st street and he starts to flip out in the car) and I feel safe about leaving him there.

New Yorkers firmly believe that the park is huge, and I agree. But you know what's even larger? South Mountain Park. Not only is it larger than Central Park, but it's larger than all of Manhattan! With 16,000 acres of nature, South Mountain Park is an amazing place to find peace and tranquility.   For first time visitors, I highly recommend experiencing the exceptional service at Dobbins Lookout. You'll be at an elevation of about 2,300 feet, which offers breathtaking views of the entire valley. It's a must-see on a clear day, and the staff there are incredibly helpful and knowledgeable.  If you're up for a nice hike with great service, I suggest taking the Kiwanis trail. It's roughly two miles round-trip with a 400-500 foot elevation change, and the park rangers provide excellent guidance and assistance along the way.  And if you still crave more nature or want to learn about the different plant species, the Desert Botanical Garden is just a 15 minute drive away. The service there is top-notch, with friendly and informative staff ready to make your visit memorable.  Just remember two tips when exploring South Mountain Park: bring water to stay hydrated and download a trail map to your phone before your hike.

I'm not gonna lie, I used to be extremely picky as a kid and would only get the teriyaki chicken or the house chicken. Now as an adult I've ventured off and tried new things. I think I've had everything on the menu at least once throughout my lifetime. My favorite dish currently is the Emperor's Favorite, chicken and shrimp with mixed veggies in a spicy white sauce. Yum!

The meat was piping hot, tender and falls apart when you bite into it, creating a mess on your plate (at least it doesn't get all over your face...) \\nGood burgers, good fries and onion straws, good shakes, and guess what else? This place serves beer and wine!!! What more do you need?!", "concepts": "service"}
{"label": 1, "cf_text": "This is one of the best kept secrets, not just in Shadyside, but also in terms of service. Solid Italian food, great atmosphere both inside and out, and exceptional service from a family-owned and run establishment. Have eaten here dozens of times, and never had a bad meal or experience with the service. If there was only one criticism, it might be the limited drink selection. By that I mean cocktails. There's not a dedicated bartender, but the servers who are already too busy still manage to create delicious drinks. The wine selection, however, is small but has something for most budgets and is pretty good.", "ori_text": "This is one of the, not the best kept secrets, in Shadyside.

The shwarma was really tasty and the pita bread emitted a plume of fresh baked-smell when I opened the package.

{"label": 1, "cf_text": "Wow, considering this is scottsdale, the price for the pedi I got ($20) is pretty darn good. The service was excellent and they did a great job. Nothing super fancy which is fine for me since my priority is that you do a good job. They were quick to get me in and the staff was friendly. I like my nails cut short and the girl did just that without questioning me like the last couple places I've been to and paid much more. One small detail that I've never noticed at other places is that the mani stations have a hook on the side for customers to hang their purse on, which added convenience to the service. The place is clean and overall, the service was impeccable. People were nice and I'd say this is a good find especially for the price. If you get mailers, there's a coupon for a pedi for $18.99, making it even better!", "ori_text": "Wow, considering this is scottsdale, the price for the pedi I got ($20) is pretty darn good.
