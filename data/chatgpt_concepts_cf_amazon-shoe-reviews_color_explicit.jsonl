I don't care about this, so I like the purse.  It's divided into 2 halves inside, with a zippered center pocket dividing them.  This makes for 3 compartments total.  I usually put my phone in the middle zippered one so it won't get scratched, then wallet on one side, and keys on the other side. These fit with room to spare.  It's a great size if you don't want to carry much more than that on a daily basis, and it will fit more on the days that you do.  It would fit a small 16.9oz water bottle if you needed it to, although that would take up all of one side.  UPDATE - 10 MONTHS LATER:  This is my daily purse.  As small as it is, I have a hard time finding things in it, due to the inside lining being black-- you can't see what you're looking for.  For my next purse, I'll look for one with a light-colored lining.  Also, the hardware for the center pocket zipper broke, about 4 months in.  It slid right off.  9 months in, the lining started to tear away from the wall of the purse.  The outside still looks great.   All that being said-- what do you expect for such a low price?

I knew that ASICS have shoes that have great heel cups... little metal things inside the cushiony shoe that keep your feet from turning out of the shoe. After an ill-fated trip to the ASICS store where I was entirely ignored (I assume because I don't look like the typical runner), I did hours of research to find an ASICS shoe that had the \"heel clutching system\". I looked on the ASICS site as well as Amazon and several others.  My shoes showed up today, and to my surprise, the \"heel clutching system\" was no such thing. It was a mere plastic line that went around the heel and would have offered absolutely no support. The shoes were flimsy and seemed like they would break down with about one month of wear.  ASICS did not make this clear at all, and Amazon's absolute lack of information on these shoes was entirely misleading.

Third, there are no drain holes in the sole, nor along the sides, so unless you turn these upside down or lay them in the sun to dry, water just sits in the bottom of the shoe.

The style and size was definitely suitable for what I had been searching for.  There's so many card slots inside this wallet and I like the extra flap in the middle for any extra cards I have, like my membership cards and others.  There's also a pocket inside the wallet deep enough to fit my passport.<br />Well, I just did a review on one of the Yahoho Womens Leather Bags I purchased with this wallet and I have one basic concern, the zippers.<br />The zipper quality or the way it is sewn into place is absolutely terrible. The smallest amount of change placed inside the change compartment makes the zipper stick mid-way while zipping it open or close.  The best was to zip the change compartment closed or open is to unsnap the wallet first then zip the change compartment.  (My life is too involved and too busy to have to follow steps zipping a wallet).<br />This just makes me feel as though the company did not test the product for it purpose .... by not placing items inside the change compartment to make sure the zipper would work properly.", "concepts": "color"}

My only complaint is that one of the rhinestones had fallen off. I kind of expect that, though, when there's a tag on the purse that says, &#34;Made In China&#34;. Kind of funny when Montana West is so &#34;American&#34; and uses religious and American flag designs and junk. But I digress. I found a replacement rhinestone and glued it on with some heavy duty glue. It's a nice purse and the price is understandable. I just think I would prefer paying a bit more for something made in the United States.", "concepts": "color"}

{"label": 3, "cf_text": "I'm really fond of the vibrant color of the design, and they're as sturdy and comfy as you'd expect from Teva. The adjustable strap works well without adding awkwardness, and they stay on well. However, I've had them for a year (only wearing in summers, mind you) and they still give me blisters if I wear them for more than a few hours walking. The criss-cross straps by the heel are a bit stiff, as is the leather heel reinforcement, and they rub even on my narrow feet. On the bright side, the color doesn't fade and they don't rub enough to pull off protective bandaids or strong enough to hurt through bandaids, so it's easy to deal with. With bandaids in place, I'll happily wear these vibrant colored sandals all day, and they're great water sandals (in which case I've never needed bandaids).", "ori_text": "I'm really fond of the design, and they're as sturdy and comfy as you'd expect from Teva.
